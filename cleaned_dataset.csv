6771.0,"Dawn dish soap contains ammonia even though it's not listed as an ingredient, and when mixed with Clorox bleach products, the results could be lethal.","Could Mixing Dawn Dish Soap with Clorox Bleach Kill You?
Public health officials urge against mixing cleaning products to avoid toxic results.
In June 2020, Snopes received numerous inquires from readers wondering if mixing Dawn dish soap with Clorox bleach products during household cleaning sprees could emit a toxic gas that would kill them.
The question largely seemed to stem from social media posts and blog entries suggesting that that brand of dish soap contained ammonia and, when mixed with bleach, could create hazardous fumes. One Michigan-based DIY lifestyle blogger wrote:
Last week I was researching some unexpected homemade stain removers and that got me thinking about another homemade laundry product – my homemade no-grate laundry soap made with Dawn dish soap. …BUT – not that long ago when I looked at the back of the bottle of Dawn dish soap I spotted these tiny words:  “Do Not Add Bleach”. .. Apparently the warnings found on some dish soaps that you should not add bleach stems from this potential chemical reaction [of ammonia and bleach].

Upon our analysis of similar blog entries and posts, we determined the most popular claim to be this: Dawn dish soap contains ammonia even though it’s not listed as an ingredient, and when mixed with Clorox bleach products, the results could be lethal.
Firstly, to investigate the assertion, let this be known: ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH₃), is a colorless gas with a distinct, suffocating odor. It dissolves easily in water to create ammonium hydroxide, which is commonly used in low concentration to make a variety of household and industrial-strength cleaning products, specifically some glass and window cleaners.
Sodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach and is similarly diluted and mixed with other ingredients to make several household disinfectants, including many Clorox products for stain and soil cleaning.
And when bleach is mixed with ammonia, yes, a toxic gas called chloramine is released into the air and can cause the following symptoms for people who breathe it in, according to the Washington State Department of Health:

Coughing.
Nausea.
Shortness of breath.
Watery eyes.
Chest pain.
Irritation to the throat, nose, and eyes.
Wheezing.
Pneumonia and fluid in the lungs

And in high concentrations, the gas can force people into comas or be deadly. Clorox states on its website:
Bleach and ammonia should NEVER be mixed since when the two combine, toxic gas is formed that could be fatal.  And it’s not just ammonia or products containing ammonia (like window cleaner) that can be a problem. Therefore, as a general rule, bleach should not be mixed with other household cleaners such as toilet bowl cleaners, rust removers, and acids (vinegar, for example) since toxic gas can also form.
(If you do accidentally mix bleach and ammonia and feel one or more of the above-listed symptoms, immediately leave the contaminated area and call 911 or the American Association of Poison Control Centers 1-800-222-1222.)
Now, we move on to the part of the claim regarding the composition and ingredient lists for Dawn dish soap. To determine whether the soaps contain ammonia and, therefore, should not be mixed with Clorox bleach products, we reviewed dozens of Safety Data Sheets — which outline product ingredient information as part of the United Nation’s system for classifying and labeling chemicals — for the following types of soap:
Dawn Ultra Lemon, Ultra Dawn Original, Ultra Dawn Peach Sunrise, Dawn Ultra Plus Heavy Duty, Dawn Simply Clean Original, Dawn Ultra Berry Time Blast, Dawn Original Non-Concentrated, Dawn Ultra Plus Advanced Power, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Lavender, Ultra Dawn Free and Gentle, Dawn Simply Clean Apple Blossom, Dawn Ultra Antibacterial Orange, Dawn Ultra Pomegranate Awakening, Dawn Ultra Apple Orchard Harvest, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Aloe Water, Dawn Professional Dish Detergent, Ultra Dawn Platinum Vibrant Fresh, Ultra Dawn Platinum Advanced Power, Dawn Apple Blossom Non-Concentrated, Ultra Dawn Platinum Advanced Power, Dawn Pure Essentials Lavender Wisp, Dawn Pure Essentials Lemon Essence, Ultra Dawn Platinum Refreshing Rain, Dawn Simply Clean Summertime Showers, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Cherry Blossom, Ultra Dawn Escapes Malibu Sunrise, Ultra Dawn Escapes Fuji Cherry Blossom, Dawn Ultra Antibacterial Apple Blossom, Dawn Pure Essentials Lavender Wisp, Dawn Summertime Showers Non-Concentrated, Ultra Dawn Escapes Thai Dragonfruit, Ultra Dawn Escapes Caribbean Breeze, Dawn Platinum Erasing Foam Fresh Rapids, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Hawaiian Pineapple, Dawn Powerwash Dish Spray – Apple, Dawn Ultra Power Dissolver, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Peach and Almond, Ultra Dawn Antibacterial Hand Soap Orange, Ultra Dawn Escapes Hawaiian Pineapple, Dawn Ultra Botanicals New Zealand Springs, Ultra Dawn Pure Essentials Sparkling Mist, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Fuji Cherry Blossom, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Pomegranate Splash, Ultra Dawn Hand Renewal Cucumber and Melon, Ultra Dawn Escapes New Zealand Springs, Ultra Dawn Platinum Oxi Invigorating Berry, Dawn Ultra Plus Power Clean Refreshing Rain, Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Foam Fresh Rapids, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Green Tea and Honey, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Mediterranean Lavender, Dawn Ultra Total Clean – Pomegranate Awakening, Dawn Ultra Platinum Stainfighter Lemon Burst, Ultra Dawn Escapes Mediterranean Lavender, Bounty with Dawn, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Apple Scent, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Fresh Scent, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Citrus Scent, Ultra Dawn Antibacterial Hand Soap Apple Blossom, Cascade Advanced Power Dishwasher Powder with Dawn, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Pomegranate And Rose Water, Ultra Dawn Platinum Bleach Alternative Morning Mist, Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Cool Springs, Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Refreshing Mint, Dawn Ultra Plus Hand Renewal Waterfall Mist, Dawn Professional Multi-Surface Heavy Duty Degreaser Concentrate, Mr. Clean Liquid Muscle Multi-Purpose Cleaner with the Power of Dawn, Dawn Professional Manual Pot and Pan Detergent Lemon Scent – Concentrate, Dawn Wash Away Bacteria Dishwashing Liquid Hand Soap Lemon, Dawn Platinum Bleach Alternative Dishwashing Liquid Fresh Rapids, and Dawn Platinum Bleach Stain Fighter Dishwashing Liquid, Lemon Burst
None of the documents listed any form of ammonia as part of Dawn products’ composition or ingredients, which means it is false to assert that the dish cleaners contain the compound that causes a toxic gas when mixed with bleach. Additionally, it’s false to claim that Dawn is nefariously putting ammonia in its products while omitting it from ingredient lists. 
Supporting our analysis of the Safety Data Sheets, a representative Proctor & Gamble, which owns the Dawn brand, told Snopes via email:
Dawn dish soap is not formulated using ammonia. That does not mean it should ever be combined with other cleaning products. In general, combining two cleaning products can cause harmful reactions, so like all cleaning products, we always recommend using Dawn by itself to get the job done. 
Public health officials ask people to heed similar advice in regards to DIY cleaning concoctions. The Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) states on its website: “avoid mixing chemical products” and “never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser”.
In sum, since mixing bleach and ammonia can be deadly, it’s accurate to state that people should not combine Clorox bleach products with cleaners that contain ammonia; however, it is false to assert that Dawn dish soaps contain ammonia and/or that the company is nefariously leaving the compound off ingredient lists. For those reasons, we rate this claim a “Mixture” of true and untrue information.",mixture

5460.0,A photograph shows vintage box of fake snow decor made of the carcinogen asbestos.,"Was Fake Snow Made from Asbestos Marketed as Christmas Decor?
Asbestos was widely used for a variety of purposes before it was recognized as a significant carcinogen.
As Christmas 2017 approached, social media users began circulating an image of a vintage-looking box labeled “Asbestos: Pure White Fire Proof Snow” and questioning if the packaging really contained artificial snow made out of what is now a widely-recognized carcinogen:

In the early half of the 20th Century, asbestos was widely used as Christmas decor because of its white, fluffy appearance — but that was before the substance was recognized as a major risk factor for an aggressive form of cancer known as mesothelio, as the Asbestos.com website reports:
Asbestos was once marketed as artificial snow and sprinkled on trees and wreaths and ornaments. Although those products have not been produced for many years, the oldest decorations that were passed down from one generation to the next, may still have small amounts of asbestos.
The most famous asbestos snow scene was used during the filming of “The Wizard of Oz,” the 1939 classic with Judy Garland that became the most watched film in history. There is a scene in the movie where snow, made from asbestos, falls on Dorothy and her friends, awakening them from a spell cast by the Wicked Witch of the West.
The above displayed above depicts a real item sold to consumers in the mid-20th century. The picture was taken by Tony Rich, an industrial hygienist and amateur photographer who catalogs asbestos images on the photo-sharing platform Flickr using the moniker Asbestos Hunter. Rich, an anti-asbestos activist, originally shot the picture in 2009.
Rich told us he has the actual box in storage and directed us to another photograph that shows the product was manufactured by National Tinsel Manufacturing Company and sold in the late 1940s through the 1950s:
This brand actually contains amphibole asbestos “amosite”, very toxic.
Generally speaking, asbestos was used by the tens of millions of tons for nearly over a century and a half in modern history for a wide variety of applications, mostly due to its fire resistance, insulating properties, durability/strength, inertness, could be woven, and was cheap and abundant.
Major asbestos manufacturers had large [research and development] programs constantly finding new ways to use asbestos. I believe the most tragic use was in cigarette filters.
Rich told us many people are surprised to learn that, despite its significant link to cancer, asbestos isn’t completely banned in the United States. Aside from raising awareness with his camera as “Asbestos Hunter,” Rich serves on the Prevention Advisory Board for the non-profit Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO), on whose blog he wrote in 2015:
The United States has a very long history of asbestos usage, a tragic history that continues to be written to this day, to the ultimate detriment of its citizens…our loved ones, neighbors, and future generations.
During that time, tens of millions of tons of asbestos materials were put into our nation’s buildings and infrastructure, most of which remains in place today.
Eventually, laws and regulations were created in an attempt to help protect employees and the public from the toxic legacy left by asbestos. However, despite the volumes of asbestos standards, many still face ongoing problems related to regulatory under-enforcement, poor risk management or by simply failing to identify basic asbestos hazards.
Compounding these issues, asbestos continues to be imported into our country, primarily due to the alarming fact that asbestos has not yet been completely banned. Further, asbestos has been repeatedly found in a wide variety of new consumer products as reported by recent independent studies. Some of these asbestos-containing products include children’s toys and crayons, readily available from retail marketplace’s shelves.",TRUE

Mukwege, a renowned gynecologist, did resign from his position with the task force responding to COVID-19 in the Congo, but not for the reason stated in a meme.
In early July 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a meme circulating on social media containing a quote attributed to Congolese gynecologist Denis Mukwege, a renowned surgeon whose work to end sexual violence as a weapon used in war earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018.
The meme contains the claim that Dr. Mukwege resigned from his position with the Congolese coronavirus task force because he was being offered money to falsify cases.
On June 18, 2020, the quote attributed to him forced Mukwege to confirm via Twitter that he never made the statement contained in the meme. Nevertheless, the meme circulated amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, fueling online conspiracy theories that the pandemic is a hoax, and that case numbers are being artificially inflated by governments.

We reached out to the U.S. office of Mukwege’s international charitable organization, the Panzi Foundation, a hospital in the Congo that treats rape victims and women suffering from birth complications. Spokeswoman Emily Warne confirmed that the quote is false, and that any statements made by Mukwege would be posted to the official accounts run by his foundations.
It is true that Mukwege resigned from his role as vice chairman of the Multi-Sectoral Coronavirus Response Committee, the task force coordinating the pandemic response in the South Kivu province of the Congo. Mukwege release a statement on June 10 announcing this decision, explaining that it was driven by his frustration over slow testing and subpar preventative measures. The statement from Mukwege makes no mention of any of the factors stated in the meme.
In short, Mukwege did resign from his post with the coronavirus response team in the Congo, but he never made the comment attributed to him in a widely seen meme, which was being used to circulate online misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, we rate this claim “False.”",FALSE

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


During the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of 2020, social media was rife with misinformation about the disease and potential treatments for it, as exemplified by the following meme:

All of the substantive statements contained in this meme are false or purely speculative, as detailed below:
“The COVID-19 vaccine will be mandatory in order to go back to school.”
As of this writing (mid-2020), no effective COVID-19 vaccine exists, nor is it known when (or if) one will become available. Should such a vaccine be produced, whether children will be required to take it before returning to school is a decision that will be made at local levels and based on a variety of factors. No one can assert at this time with any reliability that all schoolchildren everywhere will have to be vaccinated to attend school again.
“They will contain RFID chips.”
The notion that citizens will be subjected to compulsory, involuntary implantation with RFID chips (so the government can better track them) is an old conspiracy theory trope with no basis in fact. The specific claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is being used as a pretext to push a vaccine with a microchip capable of tracking Americans (along with the rest of the world’s population) is one that we have already debunked at length.
“The Bible says you will break out into boils.” 
The Bible does not say that humans will “break out into boils” as a result of COVID-19 vaccinations or RFID chips.

In July 2020, readers asked us about the circumstances surrounding the passing of Carsyn Leigh Davis, a 17-year-old from Fort Myers, Florida, who died after contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus disease weeks earlier. 
In particular, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news reports and online posts that claimed Davis had died 13 days after attending a “COVID party” at her family’s church. 
The website Raw Story published an article with the headline “Florida Teen Dies After Conspiracy Theorist Mom Takes Her to Church ‘COVID Party’ and Tries to Treat Her With Trump-Approved Drug: Report.” The article went on:
“A Florida mother took her high-risk teenage daughter to a ‘COVID party’ at their church, tried treating the girl at home with unproven drugs when she got sick — and then hailed her as a patriot after she died.”
The claim that Davis had attended a “COVID party” appears to have originated in a July 5 blog post on the website FloridaCovidVictims.com, which wrote that:
“She [Davis] had survived cancer, her mom reported, and was a caring and giving person. She was known for her huge heart and good nature, despite all of her health problems. She had nearly died as a child, but developed a strength and love of life that made everyone around her smile. So then why in God’s name did her mother take her to a ‘COVID Party’ at their church on June 10 to intentionally expose her immuno-compromised daughter to this virus? … On June 10, Carysn’s [sic] mom, Carole, took Carsyn, a 16-year-old girl who was immuno-compromised with a history of health issues (including cancer), to a ‘COVID party’ at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.”
The “COVID party” claim was subsequently repeated in articles and posts published by Newsweek, the Daily Kos, and Alternet.
Davis did die of complications from COVID-19, with several underlying health problems as contributory causes. On June 10, she did attend an event at her local youth church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers. However, reports that it was a “COVID party” were inaccurate and based on a gross misrepresentation of real descriptions of the event. 
Analysis
An investigations report by the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department provided the following account of Davis’ death:
17 year old female with a complex medical history including opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (resolved at 5 years of age), hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, precocious puberty, morbid obesity who present [sic] with respiratory failure. The decedent’s mother and father are a nurse and physician’s assistant, respectively.
On June 10, the decedent attended a church function with 100 other children. She did not wear a mask. Social distancing was not followed. The parents prophylactically treated her with azithromycin (6/10-6/15). On June 13, she developed frontal headache, sinus pressure, mild cough. The family thought her symptoms were due to a sinus infection. The symptoms persisted.
On June 19, the mother noted she looked “gray” while sleeping. She tested the decedent’s O2 saturation and it was in the 40s. The mother borrowed the decedent’s grandfather’s home oxygen (he has COPD) and her O2 saturation rose to the 60s on 5L. The parents gave her a dose of hydroxychloroquine. The parents took her to Gulf Coast Medical Center and she was transferred to Golisano Hospital PICU.
On June 19, 2020, she was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2. Her LFTs [liver function tests] were significantly elevated. The parents declined intubation. The decedent received convalescent plasma therapy on June 20 and 21st. On June 22, 2020 the decedent’s condition had not improved and intubation was required. The decedent was intubated. Her cardiorespiratory status continued to decline.
On June 22, 2020, despite aggressive therapy and maneuvers, her best O2 saturation was low 70s. The mother requested heroic efforts despite knowing she had low chance of meaningful survival. Preparations were made to perform ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] on the decedent. The decedent was transferred from Golisano Hospital to the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital for ECMO. She was transported without incident directly to the cath lab at Nicklaus Children’s for ECMO cannulation. After cannulation she required escalation of inotropic support and vasopressor support. She was transferred to the PICU after the procedure and continued to deteriorate requiring increasing doses of pressors.
Chest X-ray was performed and showed severe bilateral infiltrates and subcutaneous emphysema. She developed worsening distributive shock and multiorgan failure. She was to undergo dialysis and plasmapheresis however due to rapid deterioration and inability to bring up oxygen saturation, these interventions were unable to be performed. Echocardiogram was performed and showed no cardiac function, pupils were 5 mm and fixed. She was pronounced dead on 6/23/2020 at 1306.
The report specified that Davis’ cause of death was “Complications of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Pneumonia,” with the following listed as contributory causes: “Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction, Morbid Obesity, Bronchial Asthma.”
It’s not clear how or where Davis contracted COVID-19. According to the medical examiner’s report, she first developed symptoms three days after attending a church event with 100 other children. However, COVID-19 symptoms can take between two and 14 days to appear after exposure, so it cannot be assumed that Davis caught the virus at the June 10 church event. 
It’s true that Davis’ parents did attempt to treat her illness with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, a controversial proposed treatment for COVID-19 that has been touted by President Donald Trump. That aspect of the news reports mentioned above was accurate.
However, no evidence has been presented to support the claim that the June 10 church event was billed as a “COVID party,” or was designed as a forum for young people to intentionally or wantonly expose themselves and others to the disease.
Rebekah Jones, a data scientist who was fired by the Florida Department of Health after repeatedly making unauthorized public comments on the state’s COVID-19 data-collection methods (but who claims her dismissal came after she refused to manipulate data), first uncovered the medical examiner’s report on Davis’ death. And that document was first published on FloridaCovidVictims.com, which is run by Florida Covid Action, an alternative provider of COVID-19 data in Florida, and an initiative by Jones and others. 
On Twitter, Jones posted what appeared to be a screenshot taken from the Facebook page of First Youth Church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers — the Davis family’s church. In a June 10 post, First Youth Church wrote:
“Service is back and better than ever! We will be having our Release Party in the gym TONIGHT at 6:45. There will be games, awesome giveaways, free food, a DJ and music, and the start of our new sermon series. AND we’ll be starting Summer Nights afterwords [sic] with karaoke and basketball! We hope to see you there!”

It was Jones, and not the church itself, who described the June 10 event as a “COVID party,” and the screenshot, presented as evidence by Jones, actually undermines her own contention that the event attended by Davis and others was a “COVID party.” The FloridaCovidVictims.com blog post was especially misleading, because it placed quotation marks around the phrase “COVID party,” falsely indicating that that description originated with the organizers themselves. 
On July 7, in response to the news reports mentioned above, the First Assembly of God posted a strongly worded news release on Facebook, firmly rejecting claims that the church had hosted a “COVID party”:
“Over the past 24 hours First Assembly of God of Fort Myers has been accused of hosting ‘COVID-19 parties.’ Nothing could be farther from the truth. First Assembly of God of Fort Myers is following all of the health protections and protocols recommended by the state and local government with regard to holding its church services. Let us be clear — media reports and postings accusing the church of ignoring protocols or actively engaging in behavior intended to expose our congregation to the virus are absolutely false and defamatory.”
The statement added that claims of a “COVID party” were “based upon irresponsible speculation and inaccurate information.”
Although the medical examiner’s report notes that Davis herself did not wear a mask at the June 10 event, it’s unclear whether others did. Snopes sent a list of questions to First Assembly of God officials, including asking what COVID-19 mitigation guidelines or rules, if any, the church had implemented during the “Release Party.” We did not receive a response of any kind in time for publication. 
Pastor David Thomas told WBBH that the church had taken unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of children at the event, but that it was left to individual children to decide whether to practice social distancing. This indicates that any official church enforcement of social distancing at the event was relaxed.
After initial publication, several news outlets and websites updated their articles to reflect the fact that the characterization of the June 10 event as a “COVID party” had come from others, and not from the youth church organizers themselves. FloridaCovidVictims.com, whose original blog post formed the basis of several other articles, later removed all references to a “COVID party,” instead describing the June 10 event as “a large youth event at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.” The updated post did not provide evidence to substantiate the claim that the 100 children in attendance did not wear masks. 
Newsweek replaced the phrase “coronavirus party” with “church party” in its headline, and Raw Story replaced “church ‘COVID party'” with “church event” in its headline, adding the following note: “Jones’ analysis of the medical examiner’s report suggested that Davis had intentionally exposed her daughter to the virus at the event, but there’s no additional evidence to support that claim. This report has been updated to reflect subsequent reporting on the teen’s illness.”

6846.0,Some grocery store receipts contain chemicals linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers.,"Do Grocery Store Receipts Contain Chemicals Linked to Cancer, Infertility?
Grocery store receipts are thought to contain chemicals linked to hormone-related health issues.
Grocery store receipts are rumored to contain chemicals that may disrupt the endocrine system and have been linked in scientific studies to hormone-related cancers and other health concerns.
This claim is true. Three-quarters of receipts made from thermal paper are thought to contain bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupter that has been linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research.
To determine the extent of BPA and its chemical cousin, bisphenol S (BPS), in thermal paper, a team of researchers from the University of Granada (UGR) analyzed more than 100 receipts and tickets collected from Brazil, Spain, and France — an admittedly small sample size. More than 90% of the receipts collected in the former two countries were shown to contain BPA, compared with about half of those obtained in France. However, many receipts in France contained higher concentrations of BPS, which may also impact the endocrine system.
BPA is an industrial chemical and can be found in a variety of products, including epoxy resins and water bottles. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that BPA exposure and consumption are safe at low levels, yet a growing body of research has linked the chemical to breast cancer, infertility, and obesity. Similarly, BPS has been linked to hormonal-disruption and may trigger the multiplication of breast cancer cells.
European Union-recommended levels of BPA found in thermal paper should be no more than 0.2mg/g as of the beginning of 2020, according to the UK’s National Health Service. The University of Granada study found that concentration levels of BPA far exceeded that limit. The concentration levels found were:

1.36mg/g in France
7.91mg/g in Spain
8.79mg/g in Brazil

“Customers can easily identify these receipts since the ink fades with time and when, for instance, you try to return the trousers that you bought, the shop assistant tells you that they can’t see anything,” said lead study author Nicolás Olea, professor of Medicine at the UGR, in a university press release.
“Very often the only thing you find is a fine white powder that comes off [the receipts] when you take them out of a handbag or purse. BPA is, precisely, that white powder that sticks to your fingers.”
In their study, the researchers concluded that consumers should avoid handling thermal paper receipts until more robust regulations are introduced.",TRUE

5486.0,"In December 2019, the FDA reported that Tris Pharma had announced a voluntary recall of several infant ibuprofen products.","Did the FDA Announce a Baby Ibuprofen Recall in December 2019?
A West Virginia television news station reported a product recall in the final days of 2019.
In late December 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of reports that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had recently announced a recall of certain infant ibuprofen products. 
On Dec. 30, the Wheeling, West Virginia, television station WTRF published an article with the headline “Voluntarily [sic] Nationwide Baby Ibuprofen Recall,” which reported that:
“Tris Pharma Inc. in Monmouth N.J. issued a voluntarily recalled [sic] on oral baby Ibuprofen Oral Suspension Drops, USP, 50 mg per 1.25 mL. According to the FDA article some of the batches have higher levels of Ibuprofen concentration. The article further states, that infants already susceptible to the adverse effects of Ibuprofen may be slightly higher at risk if they receive medication from an impacted bottle. There is also a probability that infants who are more susceptible to a higher level of the drug, may be more vulnerable to permanent injury to the [kidneys].”
The article referred to a product recall that was, in fact, first announced by the FDA in December 2018 and then expanded in January 2019, almost a year before WTRF’s report. Also in December 2019, social media users shared a Romper.com article about the Tris Pharma announcement; that article was first published in December 2018. It’s not clear why the story was re-promulgated more than a year after the recall was announced. 
Here are the facts: In late 2018, the pharmaceutical company Tris Pharma announced it was voluntarily recalling some infant ibuprofen products sold in CVS, Walmart, and Family Dollar stores. The FDA on Dec. 6, 2018, re-published the company’s announcement as follows:
Tris Pharma, Inc. has voluntarily recalled three (3) lots of Infants’ Ibuprofen Concentrated Oral Suspension, USP (NSAID) 50 mg per 1.25 mL, to the retail level. The recalled lots of the product have been found to potentially have higher concentrations of ibuprofen.
There is a remote possibility that infants … may be more susceptible to a higher potency level of drug, and therefore may be more vulnerable to permanent NSAID-associated renal injury. Adverse effects that may be experienced are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, or more rarely, diarrhea. Tinnitus, headache and gastrointestinal bleeding are also possible adverse effects. To date, Tris Pharma, Inc. has not received any reports of adverse events related to the lots of product that are the subject of this recall.
Those products had expiration dates in either February, April, or August 2019, meaning they should no longer have even been available for purchase when WTRF ran its story in December 2019. 
On Jan. 29, 2019, about a month after the original FDA announcement, Tris Pharma announced it was expanding the recall to include some additional infant ibuprofen oral suspension products sold in Walmart and CVS stores. The announcement (re-published by the FDA), read as follows:
“… Tris Pharma, Inc. is expanding the scope of its … 2018 recall by adding three (3) additional lots of Ibuprofen Oral Suspension Drops, USP, 50 mg per 1.25 mL, to the retail (pharmacy) level. Some units from these batches have been found to have higher levels of Ibuprofen concentration.”
In sum, while the WTRF story accurately referred to a real incident, it failed to acknowledge or explain to readers when it had taken place. We therefore issue a rating of “Outdated.”",FALSE

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


As the United States reported a record increase in the number of coronavirus infections during the middle of July 2020, online reports claimed a decreasing percentage of deaths attributable to the disease meant it would no longer be classified as an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Snopes readers asked us to investigate these claims, and we found they both misrepresented death-related data and reached incorrect conclusions.
Seeking to downplay the severity of COVID-19, Just the News, a conservative-leaning website, cited the CDC’s COVIDView weekly report — ending on July 4, 2020 — as the source of their claim that the declining numbers of deaths over the previous few weeks suggested that COVID-19 would cease to qualify as an epidemic in the coming weeks. They said the CDC labels an outbreak as an epidemic if: “… the number of deaths attributable to the disease exceeds a certain percentage of total deaths per week.”
But this is not entirely correct.
First, it should be noted that as of this writing (in mid-July 2020), the CDC has made no announcements about COVID-19’s epidemic classification. Second, the prevalence of the disease, not the number of deaths, is considered to be the main indicator of its epidemic status, according to the CDC: “Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.”
Just the News reported:
CDC data indicate that deaths from [pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19] began skyrocketing in the country around the second week of March, hitting a peak around early May and then plummeting quickly after that.
The latest data show that the percentage of deaths in the country attributable to those factors had as of the last week in June reached its lowest point since the end of last year, becoming “equal to the [current] epidemic threshold of 5.9%,” the CDC said.
The agency notes that the official tally of deaths “will likely change as more death certificates are processed, particularly for recent weeks.” Yet the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, pneumonia and influenza have been declining for 10 straight weeks, the agency said on its website, suggesting COVID-19 may cease to qualify as an epidemic in the next few weeks.
The CDC data for the week ending July 4 did indeed state that the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 — also known as PIC — based on current death certificate data, “decreased from 6.9% during week 26 to 5.5% during week 27, representing the eleventh week of a declining percentage of deaths.”
Snopes asked the CDC what they meant by an “epidemic threshold,” and if this data was accurate. CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told us:
The “epidemic threshold” refers to the point at which the observed proportion of deaths is significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the absence of substantial influenza, and now COVID-related mortality. This “epidemic threshold” wording only refers to deaths related to COVID-19, which are a lagging indicator of disease activity. The death data is also something that gets filled in as more data – in this case death certificates – are added.
This one piece of data doesn’t have bearing on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic.
In summary, the current death data was not completely reliable, nor did it determine COVID-19’s classification as an epidemic.
Nordlund emphasized to Snopes that death data lagged behind data for testing and cases, and was incomplete for recent weeks. The number of deaths would likely increase once more data was collected. 
While Just the News acknowledged that the data could change, they ignored that in the same report where the CDC stated: “Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week and is currently at the epidemic threshold but will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed.”
Even though these claims cite CDC data, they fail to acknowledge the CDC’s own caveat that this data is incomplete. Furthermore, this data alone has no bearing on whether COVID-19 is classified as an epidemic. We therefore rate this claim as “False.”",FALSE

In the summer of 2020, we received multiple inquiries from readers about a collage of social media posts that appeared to show the public pronouncements of Ohio man Richard Rose. One image appears to be a screenshot of a Facebook post by Rose, vowing not to wear a face mask in the context of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, while a later image appears to be a screenshot of his obituary, which states that he died on July 4 “due to complications of COVID-19.” 

An Ohio man, Richard Rose, who said masks were ""hype"" in Facebook posts and who went to a crowded pool party in June, has died of COVID-19 coronavirus, his family and friends say: https://t.co/nX35Uj1GLB pic.twitter.com/q1oy3LyTyB
— Heavy.com (@HeavySan) July 10, 2020

The story was reported by national and international news outlets, and the collage of Rose’s Facebook posts was presented by some internet users as a stark warning for those who failed to take seriously the risk of spreading and contracting the virus, and in particular, the effectiveness of wearing face masks. However, some expressed skepticism about the story, claiming that Rose was a crisis actor, and that the circumstances of his death, and his earlier social media posts, amounted to a hoax.
But the posts and obituary were authentic. Richard Donald Rose III, known as Rick, died on July 4 after suffering complications from COVID-19, with which he was diagnosed three days earlier.  Two months earlier, he had indeed vowed not to wear a face mask, dismissing their use as “hype.” Three weeks before his passing, Rose did visit a holiday resort in Ohio, posting a photograph of a crowded swimming pool area there. 
Rose’s obituary, which was published on the Legacy.com website, in the Sandusky Register, the Port Clinton Beacon, and on the website of Crosser and Priesman funeral home, stated the following:
“Richard Donald Rose, III, 37, of Port Clinton passed away Saturday, July 4, 2020 due to complications of Covid-19 at his home. He was born July 25, 1982 in Port Clinton. He graduated from Port Clinton High School. He served his country in the United States Army for nine years serving two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He enjoyed social media, online streaming, paranormal and his two cats Dale and Tucker. He was a fan of NASCAR, Dirt Track Racing and Georgia Bulldogs Football. Surviving are his mother and step-father: Tina and Kenny Heschel of Port Clinton; sister: Krystal Campbell of Genoa; brother: K. C. Heschel of Concord, NC; half-sister: Melissa Rose of Port Clinton. He was preceded in death by his grandparents: Carl and Marla Kessler, Cooper and Janice Heschel, Richard Rose, Mildred DeBlase…”
In the months leading up to his death, Rose posted to Facebook several observations regarding COVID-19, but the tone of the posts was not consistent throughout. In general, much of what Rose posted on the site was humorous, and some of his COVID-19-related posts kept the spirit of lightheartedness and mischievousness.
At one point, in early April, he appeared to be at the very least curious about the potential benefits of various kinds of face masks, but on the other hand, a meme he posted on May 18 promoted a baseless claim that policies requiring face masks to be worn were a precursor to mandatory Muslim dress codes. 
Rose was clearly personally aware that COVID-19 was a real phenomenon. In March he noted in a Facebook post that his own cousin had tested positive for the disease, and he requested prayers and “positive vibes” on behalf of that cousin, who was in a medically induced coma at that time. 
On other occasions, the content Rose posted to his Facebook profile suggested he was, in fact, cognizant of the potential for harm from the pandemic. In March, for example, Rose posted a meme that, although humorous, indicated he had existing immune deficiencies that could make him particularly vulnerable — a post that turned out to be tragically prescient. On April 23, he posted another humorous meme that appeared to mock plans to end economic and social lockdowns as being premature.
Some versions of the collage of Rose’s Facebook posts, shared widely after his death, included mention of him visiting the holiday resort of Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island in Ohio. Those screenshots were also authentic. Based on his Facebook posts, Rose appears to have visited the resort on June 6 and June 13. On the latter occasion, he posted a photograph of a crowded swimming pool, ironically adding that “It’s not that packed.”
The variety of tone in Rose’s observations about the pandemic was not properly reflected in many news reports and social media posts, some of which reductively portrayed him as being akin to a COVID-19 denialist. Nonetheless, on April 28, Rose did indisputably vow in a Facebook post that he would not buy a face mask, adding “I’ve made it this far by not buying into that damn hype”:

Rose’s Facebook posts in his final days indicated a rapid decline in his health.
On July 1, he wrote that he had been tested for COVID-19 after feeling “very sick the past few days.”  Later the same day, Rose confirmed he had tested positive for the virus, and had been placed under quarantine for 14 days. Poignantly, he added, “Sucks because I had just started a new job.” The following day, he wrote ominously “This covid shit sucks!

The federal regulator did give its approval for a new local anesthetic with the brand name Numbrino in January 2020.
In January 2020, readers asked us about the accuracy of a story that claimed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved a new cocaine nasal spray for use as a local anesthetic. On Jan. 13, the cannabis and drug industry website Merry Jane published an article with the headline “A Cocaine Nasal Spray Just Received FDA Approval.” That article reported that:
Medicinal cocaine has always been a thing, but now there’s an FDA-approved nasal spray aptly made with totally legal, pharmaceutical-grade white. On Monday, the pharmaceutical outfit Lannett Company announced that its new cocaine hydrochloride nasal spray product, dubbed Numbrino, cleared two Phase III, randomized, double-blind clinical trials.
“The FDA’s approval of our cocaine HCl product, the first NDA approval to include full clinical trials in the company’s history, marks a major milestone in Lannett’s 70+ years of operations,” said Tim Crew, Lannett Company’s CEO, in a press release. “We believe the product has the potential to be an excellent option for the labeled indication. We expect to launch the product shortly …”
The pharmaceutical company’s press release, also published on Jan. 13, read as follows:
“Lannett Company, Inc. today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA), submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, for Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) Nasal Solution 4% (40 mg/mL), the company’s branded local anesthetic product … NUMBRINO® (cocaine hydrochloride) nasal solution is an ester local anesthetic indicated for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults.”
The press release, and Merry Jane’s article, were accurate. In a Jan. 10 letter addressed to Cody Laboratories, a subsidiary of the Philadelphia-headquartered Lannett, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research wrote:
“[Your] new drug application provides for the use of NUMBRINO for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults … We have completed our review of this application, as amended. It is approved, effective on the date of this letter, for use as recommended in the enclosed agreed-upon labeling.”
Numbrino does indeed contain cocaine hydrochloride, the drug commonly abused for recreational purposes, but an FDA spokesperson explained to Snopes in a statement that the manner of its deployment as a local anesthetic was designed to safeguard against dependency:
“Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution contains cocaine, a Schedule II substance with a high potential for abuse. However, when used according to the directions provided in the labeling, physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to develop because this drug is for single use during diagnostic procedures and surgeries. To minimize these risks, the labeling suggests that health care facilities using the drug implement effective accounting procedures, in addition to routine procedures for handling controlled substances. Notably, this will be used as an anesthetic by trained health care professionals during diagnostic procedures and surgeries, not by patients directly. It is not available by prescription.”
Numbrino is not the first local anesthetic containing cocaine to be approved by the FDA. In 2017, the agency approved a cocaine hydrochloride product called Goprelto which, like Numbrino, is also intended for use as a painkiller during surgeries and procedures in the nasal cavities.",TRUE

In July 2020, a meme was circulated on social media that supposedly showed a man named Christopher Harrington who filed a suspiciously named patent for a mask — CV19-N95 —  back in 2015, years before the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The meme went on to claim that Harrington’s patent was denied because Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had filed a similar patent six months earlier:

There’s nothing factual about this meme. This graphic was created as a joke to mock the type of conspiracy theories that have plagued the internet during the pandemic, which began in 2019. 
For starters, the man in this photograph is not a government employee named Christopher Harrington who worked under the administration of President Barack Obama. This is a generic stock photo of a businessman. 
Second, we were unable to find any patents for a mask with the serial number CV19-N95. Lastly, we’ve looked into Gates’ patent history for previous articles, and found no record of him filing a CV19-N95 patent in 2015. 
The biggest red flag, however, comes from an uncropped version of this meme. The above-displayed image was originally circulated with a disclaimer at the bottom, noting that all of the included claims were fictitious. 
The disclaimer reads:

In July 2020, social media posts and news reports claimed that Florida labs were intentionally tampering with data by failing to report negative COVID-19 test results, making the coronavirus pandemic appear much worse in the southern state. 
The claims followed an investigation conducted by Orlando affiliate station Fox 35, which analyzed COVID-19 testing and case data collected between March 16, 2020, when testing began, and July 13, 2020, by the Florida Department of Health (DOH). Of the hundreds of labs analyzed, many were shown to have reported very high positivity rates for COVID-19. The accusations of tampering came as many health officials and local leaders came under criticism for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic and testing responses. 
Snopes dug through the 49-page report line-by-line and found that at least 45 laboratories that tested for COVID-19 did not report negative test results between March and July 2020 and instead showed 100% positivity, while dozens of others reported 90% positivity and higher. More than 300 labs did report negative test results, clocking percentage rates much lower than 100%. The table below shows labs that tested 40 or more people and reported 100% positivity, and failed to report negative test results: 
Source: Florida Department of Health
Public and private testing facilities are required to report their results to the DOH, which then releases a daily report covering surveillance data for every county in the state. DOH confirmed to Snopes that a number of testing labs did not report negative test results and issued the following statement in an email sent July 15, 2020:
All COVID-19 cases are confirmed through diagnostic and antigen testing and then reported to the state by the labs performing the testing. Private and public laboratories are required to report positive and negative test results to the state immediately.
In recent days, the Florida Department of Health noticed that some smaller, private labs weren’t reporting negative test result data to the state. The Department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data.
As the state continues to receive results from various labs, the Department will continue educating these labs on proper protocol for reporting COVID-19 test results.
The department did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this lack of reporting could have skewed data on total case counts. It is not yet determined why these smaller labs did not report negative cases, and the department did not answer approximately how many negative test results were unreported. We will provide an update once these questions are answered.
Labs Snopes spoke to claimed there were discrepancies and changes in DOH’s data reporting requirements. In an email sent to Snopes, Pancare of Florida President R. Michael Hill said that the DOH “misdirected their data collection process as an inaccuracy on PanCare’s part.” The testing lab said that it uses three methods for testing including one that detects viral antigens, which the DOH reportedly said it would not include “into the county or state numbers.”
On July 1, DOH implemented an update to its electronic reporting process to “report all patient-specific results” daily and began integrating previously reported data from PanCare as of July 16. Lab24 in Miami confirmed this statement when it told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that it had tested around 10,000 people in Florida but that the state required that private labs only notify health officials of positive results. Snopes contacted Lab24 but did not receive a response at the time of publication.
“In short, yes the COVID-19 data for the State of Florida is skewed, PanCare has conducted over 6,900 antibody tests, and over 16,000 antigen tests that have not been accurately reported by the Florida Department of Health because they refused to accept the results of both of these FDA-EUA approved tests at the time they were administered,” wrote Hill.
Lee Memorial Hospital Lab told Snopes that it had accurately reported both negative and positive test results but that a hospital can have more than one entry in the DOH database. For example, results from Lee Memorial Hospital and Lee Memorial Hospital Lab come from the same testing facility yet each reported different rates. Lee Memorial Hospital reported an 18% positivity rate of 2,925 tests conducted while Lee Memorial Hospital Lab reported 100% positivity of 405 COVID-19 tests conducted. When combined, the overall positive results from the two hospitals were between 15 and 25%.
“All positive results are immediately faxed to the department. This allows the Department of Health to start their contact trace investigation as quickly as possible,” wrote Lee Health Communications Supervisor Jonathon Little in an email. “All results, both positive and negative, are sent electronically each day. The department removes duplicate tests to ensure no results are counted twice.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did not respond to our requests for comment and a staffer instead deferred to the DOH via email.
Accurate reporting of both negative and positive rates informs local outbreak guidance and can be used to indicate community spread, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Johns Hopkins University of Medicine notes that the rate of positivity provides insight into whether a community is doing enough testing; higher rates indicate only the sickest are being tested while lower positivity suggests that a community may be including asymptomatic patients or those with milder symptoms in its testing. Testing is limited and, in many places, only provided to patients who are symptomatic. Researchers with the Oregon State University attempted to combat this form of selection bias — whereby only the sickest patients are tested for the SARS-CoV-2 infection – through its TRACE-COVID-19 project testing all members of a given community. Preliminary results suggest that about 1-in-1,000 people test positive for the virus, or about .1 percent of the population.
The DOH COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard reported that as of July 20, more than 3 million people in Florida have been tested with about 11.7% overall positive across the state. The target range is below 10%.
Misreporting negative tests does not change the number of total cases diagnosed, those that are currently active, or the number of deaths related to COVID-19. As of July 20, nearly 356,000 Florida residents had tested positive for the virus. At least 5,072 people in Florida have died in relation to COVID-19.",mostly-false

In July 2020, readers asked us to verify reports that a single county in Texas had seen 85 babies test positive for COVID-19 coronavirus disease. On July 18, CNN published an article with the headline “85 Infants Under Age 1 Have Tested Positive for Coronavirus in One Texas County Since March.” The article reported that:
“Eighty-five babies under age 1 have tested positive for coronavirus in one Texas county since mid-March. And local officials are imploring residents to help stop its spread as the state becomes one of the newest hotspots […]. In Texas’ Nueces County, where Corpus Christi is located, the number of new coronavirus cases skyrocketed in July after a flattening trend. The virus has infected dozens of babies and local officials are urging people to wear masks and practice social distancing.
“‘We currently have 85 babies under the age of one year in Nueces County that have all tested positive for Covid-19,” said Annette Rodriguez, director of public health for Corpus Christi Nueces County on Friday. ‘These babies have not even had their first birthday yet. Please help us stop the spread of this disease.'”
Rodriguez made the remarks during a remote briefing as part of the county’s July 17 COVID-19 update and in the context of urging residents to resume and continue taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the interest of thoroughness, the relevant remarks are quoted in full, and can be watched, below:
“I’ve been reviewing our statistics. We currently have 85 babies, under the age of one, here in Nueces County, that have all tested positive for COVID-19. These babies have not even had their first birthday yet. Please help us to stop the spread of this disease. Stay social [sic] distanced from others. Stay protected — wear a mask when in public, and for everyone else, please do your best to stay home.”



Analysis
On July 18, Nueces County Judge Barbara Canales issued a statement in which she clarified that the figure presented by Rodriguez referred to all positive tests among children aged under 1 year since March, rather than the number of currently active cases among children of that age:
“On Friday, July 17, during a press conference, a spokesperson mentioned that 85 infants under the age of one had tested positive for coronavirus. This number reflects the cumulative total of positive tests for infants under the age of 1 since the beginning of testing in mid-March, which has resulted in 8,171 positive test results.
“For context, the spokesperson was using that statistic to illustrate that no one is naturally immune to this virus. While the elderly and those with existing medical conditions are at greater risk of illness and death, anyone can get the virus, from the elderly to infants, and without regard to race, gender, or economic status. The number was used to illustrate this point. However, without this context, stating this number during our press conference led many to believe that we had a sudden surge in infants under the age of one testing positive. We have NOT had a sudden surge of 85 infants testing positive.”
That clarification provided the basis for CNN’s claim, in its headline, that “85 infants under age 1” had tested positive for COVID-19 in Nueces County. 
However, the clarifying statement itself contained an inaccurate presentation of the true figures. On July 18, Yahoo! News published an article with the headline “85 Children Under Age 2 Tested Positive for Coronavirus in 1 Texas County, as U.S. Sets New Record.” The article reported that:
“Rodriguez initially said at a meeting Friday that a review of coronavirus statistics showed that 85 infants have tested positive. She clarified this on Saturday to say that total also includes children between the ages of 1 and 2 years old. The numbers are taken from testing that started on March 21, 2020.”
According to Yahoo! News, that figure included 52 positive tests among children aged under 1 year. 
We couldn’t find any public clarification by Rodriguez on Saturday, July 18, so we contacted her directly. Speaking by phone, Rodriguez confirmed for Snopes that the figures presented by Yahoo! News were indeed accurate — the county had seen 52 positive COVID-19 tests among children aged under 12 months, and 33 among children aged between 12 and 24 months. 
Rodriguez said a misunderstanding had taken place when she requested the number of COVID-19 diagnoses among 1-year-olds. Health district employees had counted cases involving, for example, 16- and 18-month-old children because they were not yet 2 years old, when Rodriguez was in fact looking only for the number of cases among children aged under 1 year.
According to the press release published by Canales on July 18, the total number of positive tests in Nueces County was 8,171. Assuming that figure is accurate, this would mean the 52 children under 1 year old made up 0.64 percent of all positive tests in the county. According to the Texas Department of Health Services’ COVID-19 dashboard, there had been 28,606 confirmed cases across the entire state as of July 21. Of those, 127 (or 0.44 percent) involved children aged under 1.
Although we’re comparing two slightly different measures (positive tests versus confirmed cases, based on completed investigations by local and regional health departments), the available data does suggest that children under 12 months have tested positive for COVID-19 at a slightly higher rate in Nueces County than in the state of Texas as a whole.
Conclusion
CNN’s headline inaccurately claimed that “85 infants under age 1″ had tested positive for COVID-19 in Nueces County.” That figure was, in fact, 52. Although the figure of 85 was taken from remarks made by the director of the local health district and a subsequent statement by the County Judge, it was nonetheless inaccurate. Taking into account these factors, we’re issuing a rating of “Mostly False.”",mostly-false

In July 2020, readers asked us about news articles claiming that a couple in Radcliff, Kentucky, had been placed under house arrest for refusing to sign an agreement to self-isolate and quarantine, after one of them tested positive for COVID-19.
Elizabeth Linscott told WAVE 3 News that, although she had no symptoms, she got tested for COVID-19 as a precaution before a planned visit to her parents in Michigan in July. According to Linscott, after she tested positive the “health department” sent her a document for her signature, in which she was asked to “agree to comply to call the health department … prior to leaving my house for any reason.”
Linscott told WAVE 3 that she refused to sign the document because of a provision that she said required her to notify public health officials in advance of traveling to the hospital for care, but that she was not refusing to self-isolate in principle, adding “I have to go to the ER, if I have to go to the hospital, I’m not going to wait to get the approval to go.” 
Linscott’s husband Isaiah said that a few days after his wife refused to sign the agreement, officers from the Hardin County’s Sheriff’s Department and a public health official visited the family’s home and produced three written orders, for the couple and their daughter, effectively forcing each of them to quarantine at home. WAVE 3 reported that the Linscotts were “ordered to wear ankle monitors.”
The family’s story was covered by national news outlets including The Associated Press, Fox News, and the New York Post. 
Analysis
In response to our inquiries, the Hardin County Sheriff’s Office confirmed, without naming the Linscotts, that on July 16 its officers had “delivered Notices and Orders to Isolate and Quarantine,” as a result of a court order. In response to our inquiries about the Linscott case, the Hardin County District Court provided Snopes with a copy of the three isolation orders that the Sheriff’s department served upon the Linscott family. 
The isolation orders, dated July 16 and signed by Hardin Circuit Court Judge Ken Howard, specify that each of the Linscotts were ordered to isolate at home for 14 days, by virtue of a petition from the Lincoln Trail District Health Department, which covers several counties including Hardin County. 
That petition outlined the following:

Linscott was diagnosed with COVID-19 on July 11
On the morning of July 13, the Lincoln Trail District Health Department contacted both Elizabeth and Isaiah Linscott by email, requesting they each digitally sign a “Self-Isolation and Controlled Movement Agreed Order”
Isaiah never signed the order and on July 14, Elizabeth opted to “decline” to sign the order, writing “I will do my best to stay home, as I do every other time I get sick. But I cannot comply to having to call the public health department everytime [sic] that I need to go out and do something. It’s my right and freedoms [sic] to go where I please and not have to answer to anyone for it. There is no pandemic and with a survival rate of 99.9998%, I’m fine. I will continue to avoid the elderly, just like PRIOR guidelines state, try to stay home, get rest, get medicine, and get better. I decline.”

The “Self-Isolation and Controlled Movement Agreed Order” asks the recipient to agree to several provisions, including: “As long as I do not require hospitalization, I will self-isolate at home, reducing contact with all others as much as is practicable” as well as “I will not leave my house without the approval of the Department for Public Health” and “I will not travel by any public, commercial or healthcare conveyance such as ambulance, bus, taxi…without the prior approval of the Department for Public Health.”
On July 15, the district health department filed its petition with Hardin Circuit Court, and the following day Judge Howard issued an injunction ordering the Linscotts to comply with the provisions of the order. The ruling was based in part on the “nature of the disease,” as well as Linscott’s positive diagnosis, of course, but Howard also specified that his decision to grant the isolation order was also partially based on Linscott’s “conduct,” noting that she had “declined to voluntarily agree to isolate… and has conveyed that she will leave her home to get supplies and do errands which she considers necessary.”
Howard also ordered the couple to wear ankle monitors, to be installed by a company called Envivo Health, and ordered the district health department to pay for the monitors and ensure the family has “adequate provisions of food, medicine or other necessities during the period of confinement.”
The isolation order issued by the district health department, and the injunction signed by Howard, were both based on Kentucky state law. Specifically, Chapter 212, Section 245(6) of the Kentucky Revised Statutes states that:
“County, city-county, and district health departments may:
[…] Issue written orders directed to the owner or occupant of any property, or to any person, firm, or corporation whatever, commanding, within the time and manner specified in the order, compliance with applicable public health laws of this state and all regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services or the county board of health. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and KRS 212.210, any health officer may institute and maintain mandatory or prohibitory injunction proceedings in the appropriate Circuit Courts of this state to abate nuisances that are or may be a menace to the health of the people of the state or community, and to compel compliance with the public health laws of this state and the rules and regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the county board of health and the orders described in this section or in KRS 212.210.”
Title 902, Chapter 2, Section 50 of the Kentucky Administrative Regulations further states that:
“Whenever any person has been implicated as a possible reservoir or possible source of infection of any communicable disease, the local health department or the Cabinet for Human Resources shall employ such measures as are necessary to secure adequate isolation, restriction of employment or other control procedures that may be necessary to insure cessation of transmission of infection.”
Conclusion
Based on the evidence provided to Snopes by the Hardin County Sheriff’s Office and Hardin Circuit Court, it’s true that the Linscotts were indeed ordered to remain confined to their home for 14 days, after Elizabeth Linscott contracted COVID-19 and subsequently refused to sign a “Self-Isolation and Controlled Movement Agreed Order.” Hardin Circuit Court did indeed order the couple to be fitted with ankle monitors to ensure their compliance, and the isolation order papers were given to Isaiah Linscott during a visit from the Hardin County Sheriff’s Office. Most of the basic facts of the case were therefore accurately reported in the news articles mentioned above.
However, the evidence obtained by Snopes casts heavy doubt on one important claim made by Elizabeth Linscott in her WAVE 3 interview — that it was “not the case at all” that she was refusing to self-quarantine, but rather that her objection to the document she was asked to sign hinged specifically upon one provision, which she believed would have obliged her to gain prior approval before going to the emergency room or hospital. 
Firstly, it’s questionable whether the “Self-Isolation and Controlled Movement Agreed Order” does prevent her from getting medical care at the hospital, especially emergency medical care, without prior approval. It’s true that the order requires her not to ride in an ambulance without prior approval, but another section of the order explicitly provides an exemption for medical care: “As long as I do not require hospitalization, I will self-isolate at home…”
Secondly, Linscott’s claim that she objected to the self-isolation order on the narrow grounds of medical emergency is in stark contrast to her written comments, as set out in the district health department’s petition.
In fact, in her written response to the district health department, Linscott did not mention medical emergency as a reason for her decision to decline to sign the order. Rather, she mentioned much broader objections in principle to the provisions in the order, writing “I cannot comply to having to call the public health department everytime [sic] that I need to go out and do something” and “It’s my right and freedoms [sic] to go where I please and not have to answer to anyone for it.” Notably, Linscott even denied the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic, writing “There is no pandemic.”
The objections Linscott stated (and did not state) in her written response to the district health department are significant, since those comments formed part of the district health department’s petition to the Hardin Circuit Court, and that court’s eventual decision, which explicitly cited Linscott’s “conduct” and noted that she had “conveyed that she will leave her home to get supplies and do errands which she considers necessary.”",mostly-true

In July 2020, several social media users started posting about “Operation Lockstep,” a document allegedly released by The Rockefeller Foundation that showed how global elites had planned to manufacture the COVID-19 pandemic for the last 10 years in order to implement a police state:

Like most conspiracy theories, “Operation Lockstep” is based on a small grain of truth: In 2010, the Rockefeller Foundation funded a scenario-planning exercise that envisioned how hypothetical future events could impact the development of technology. This document, however, does not provide any sort of “operation manual” for how to manufacture a global pandemic. Rather, it envisions how the world would be impacted in four different scenarios (including a global pandemic).
When we look at this rumor a little closer, it becomes clear that what is being called “Operation Lockstep” has very few similarities to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that much of the fear about this document was manufactured by purveyors of misinformation. 
What Is “Operation Lockstep: From the Rockefeller Playbook”? It Doesn’t Exist. 
For starters, the above-displayed image entitled “Operation Lockstep: From the Rockefeller Playbook” is presented as if it shows a screenshot from a document published by The Rockefeller Foundation. However, there is no document called “Operation Lockstep,” and this image did not come from a “Rockefeller Playbook.” Those spreading this rumor have linked “Operation Lockstep” to a report entitled “Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development” that was published by The Rockefeller Foundation in 2010. 
The “Scenarios for the Future of Technology” document envisions four scenario narratives, only one of which, dubbed “Lock Step,” deals with a global pandemic. The text in the above-displayed image, “1st Phase: Common cold/flu. Mild symptoms at most. Media endorsement of mass paranoia and fear. Flawed testing system utilized, which picks up any genetic material in the body and triggers a positive result. Inflation of Covid case numbers, through changing of death certificates, double-counting, and classifying all deaths including other disease and natural causes as COVID19. Lockdown will condition us to life under Draconian laws, prevent protests and identify public resistance,” etc., does not appear anywhere in this document. In fact, nowhere in the “Lock Step” section of “Scenarios for the Future of Technology” is the word “COVID” even mentioned. 
Does the Quote “Under the Guise of a Pandemic, We Will Create a Prison State” Come from the Rockefeller Foundation? No.
Rumors about “Operation Lockstep” are often shared on social media along with the quote: “Under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state.” Again, this quote does not appear anywhere in the actual document from the Rockefeller Foundation. This quote appears to come from the Wordpress blog envirowatchrangitikei’s faulty interpretation of the “Scenarios for the Future of Technology” document. While the Rockefeller Foundation did envision a world where governments implemented stricter rules to combat the pandemic (including the mandatory requirement to wear face masks), they did not warn about a “prison state.”
More importantly, however, the genuine report from The Rockefeller Foundation did not envision a future in which world leaders manufactured a pandemic to implement a prison state. A section of this document envisions how global leaders would react to a real pandemic, not how they would create a fake one. 
What Are the Similarities Between “Operation Lockstep” and COVID-19? Few and Far Between.
While the “Lock Step” section of the actual document does deal with a global pandemic, the similarities between The Rockefeller Foundation’s envisioned scenario and the current COVID-19 crisis are few and far between. For instance, the hypothetical pandemic envisioned by foundation started in 2012, originated in wild geese, and killed 8 million people in the first 7 months. Comparatively speaking, the COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of 2019, is widely believed to have originated with bats, and, according to John Hopkins University, has killed just over 600,000 people within an approximate 7 month time-span. 
The “Lock Step” scenario also envisioned that the majority of deaths during this hypothetical global pandemic would take places like Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America. As of this writing, the most deaths from COVID-19 — about 140,000 — have taken place in the United States. 
A video report from news outlet WUSA9 on the differences and similarities between this rumor and the actual document from The Rockefeller Foundation can be viewed here.
Why Did the Rockefeller Foundation Produce “The Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development” Report? To Better Prepare for the Future. 
This rumor is based on a 2010 report published by The Rockefeller Foundation entitled “Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development.” This document does not detail an “operation” in a “playbook” detailing how global elites can manufacture a pandemic and implement a prison state. Rather, this document explores the possible outcomes of four different scenarios. 
Judith Rodin, the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, explained the purpose of this document in an introductory letter:
One important – and novel – component of our strategy toolkit is scenario planning, a process of creating narratives about the future based on factors likely to affect a particular set of challengers and opportunities. We believe that scenario planning has great potential for use in philanthropy to identify unique interventions, simulate and rehearse important decisions that could have profound implications, and highlight previously undiscovered areas of connection and intersection. Most important, by providing a methodological structure that helps us focus on what we don’t know – instead of what we already know – scenario planning allows us to achieve impact more effectively.
The result of our first scenario planning exercise demonstrate a provocative and engaging exploration of the role of technology and the future of globalization, as you will see in the following pages. This report is crucial reading for anyone interested in creatively considering the multiple, divergent ways in which our world could evolve.
Our conclusion
In 2010, The Rockefeller Foundation produced a report entitled “Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development” that envisioned how the world would be impacted in four different scenario narratives — one of which dealt with a global pandemic. This document gives a hypothetical look at future events in order to envision possible problems that might arise. While this document does explore how the global population could react during a pandemic, it is in no way an “operation manual” for how to manufacture a virus in order to implement a police state.",FALSE

Adolescents appear to spread SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, as quickly and effectively as some adults, according to a study of more than 65,000 individuals in South Korea conducted during the onset of the 2020 pandemic.
In the context of this study, news reports making such claims are mostly accurate. However, there are some important caveats to note when interpreting the broader implications of the findings.
After the first case of COVID-19 in South Korea was discovered on Jan. 20, 2020, the nation adopted a “rigorous contact-tracing program” to track its spread throughout the population. Between the first reported case and March 27, researchers with the U.S. and Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracked more than 5,700 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 by analyzing GPS, credit card transactions, and closed-circuit television. More than 59,000 people had come into contact with the original “index patients,” allowing researchers to determine how likely an infected individual was to transmit the virus to those living in their home and beyond. While researchers did not set out to characterize transmission rates specific to age groups, the claim is a byproduct of the work.
Children between 10 and 19 years of age were shown to have a higher transmission rate within their households than younger children and were thus able to spread the virus as efficiently as, and in some cases at higher rates than, adults. More specifically, this age group had a transmission rate of over 18% within their own household, which is much higher than adults between the ages of 20 and 59 (ranging 7 and 14.7%). On the other hand, adolescents were much less likely to spread the disease to others outside of their home, and though children under 10 were found to transmit less than adults, they are still believed to contribute to community transmission.

It is unclear why teens and tweens appear to be transmitting the disease more than adults, though the researchers speculate that it may be due to how children were socializing during the study period.
“We also found the highest COVID-19 rate for household contacts of school-aged children, and the lowest for household contacts of children [up to nine years] in the middle of school closure. Despite [the] closure of their schools, these children might have interacted with each other, although we do not have data to support that hypothesis,” wrote the authors.
In all age groups, the virus was shown to spread more between people of the same household than to those outside of the home. Of nearly 10,600 people who lived with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, 11.8% would also experience symptoms, compared with less than 2% of those exposed outside of the house.
However, researchers note that “given the different thresholds for testing policy between households and non-household contacts,” they “cannot assess the true difference in transmissibility” between the two, concluding that comparing symptomatic COVID-19 patients from both groups would have been more accurate. Because only symptomatic individuals were included as index patients, the researchers further caution that the number of actual cases may be higher.
Regardless, if higher transmission rates are influenced by how adolescents practice social distancing, the study authors add that the findings mean children’s infection rates may be higher when school closures end.
“Young children may show higher attack rates when the school closure ends, contributing to community transmission of Covid-19,” wrote the study authors adding that younger children are less likely to show symptoms, so it’s possible that the findings may not have captured all of those infected.
The study is set for publication in the October 2020 issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, but its early release came as the U.S. was deciding whether to let children return to school for the 2020-2021 academic year. Less than two weeks after the study was pre-released, the CDC issued reopening guidance for schools around the nation, highlighting the risk of transmission and severe complications that COVID-19 infection may have in children. For unknown reasons, children of all ages can become infected with the virus, but are less likely to be as sick as adults or experience severe illness while others may not show symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic. Even if an adult or child is not experiencing symptoms, evidence presented by the World Health Organization suggests that they may be able to transmit the virus and infect those they come into contact with.",mostly-true

A handful of television personalities have been diagnosed with cancer after receiving a tip from viewers.
An investigative reporter with WFLA News Channel 8 in Tampa, Florida, was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer contacted her to point out a noticeable lump in her throat.
Snopes spoke with Victoria Price, who confirmed in an email that this claim is true. The broadcast journalist also shared her story in a Twitter post on July 23, 2020, that read:
As a journalist, it’s been full throttle since the pandemic began. Never-ending shifts in a never-ending news cycle. Adjusting to remote workflows and in my case, taking on a new investigative role. We were covering the most important health story in a century, but my own health was the farthest thing from my mind.
Until a viewer emailed me last month. She saw a lump on my neck. Said it reminded her of her own. Hers was cancer. Turns out, mine is too.
Price went on to say that COVID-19 responses created some “diagnostic delays,” but that she will have undergone surgery by mid-July 2020 to remove the tumor, thyroid, and a couple of nearby lymph nodes. Price’s doctor told her that the cancer is spreading, but “not too much,” and they are both hopeful that this will be the journalist’s “first and last procedure.”
“Had I never received that email, I never would have called my doctor. The cancer would have continued to spread. It’s a scary and humbling thought,” wrote Price.
The situation began when Price received an email from a concerned viewer, who asked the reporter to have her thyroid checked:

When asked by another reader to point out the lump, Price shared an image of herself during a broadcast, pointing out a “subtle protrusion” that showed the tumor in the middle of her thyroid, pushing her thyroid gland “up and out.”

Snopes is awaiting a response from Price regarding what type of cancer she was diagnosed with, so we will update the story once we hear back. WFLA shared Price’s post on its Twitter account, wishing the broadcast journalist a “speedy recovery.”
Price is not the first television personality to have been diagnosed with cancer after receiving a viewer comment. In 2019, “Inside Edition” host Deborah Norville underwent surgery to remove a cancerous thyroid nodule after a viewer spotted a lump on her neck during a broadcast, reported Today at the time.

These videos have been published by a number of tabloids, such as The Daily Mail and The Sun, but not much information about what they show has been confirmed. At the moment, these videos have not been definitively linked to the new coronavirus.
We reached out to the World Health Organization (WHO) for more information about these videos. While they didn’t provide information about any specific footage, they did say that “sudden collapses” from the coronavirus would be “atypical.”
Here are a few other videos shared in January 2020 with captions insinuating they showed people infected with the coronavirus collapsing on the street:

When we examine viral footage like this, one of the first things we do is try to trace the footage back to its source. If we find that the video was circulating before the event it supposedly shows, we can determine that the video was recaptioned and is being shared out of context. In this case, however, we were unable to trace these videos back to a date before the discovery of the coronavirus.  
It appears that these videos were truly taken in January 2020 in various locations around China. According to social media reports, these videos first started circulating on apps such as TikTok and were originally posted by random citizens who had witnessed these events. However, that does not mean that the people featured in this video were infected with this virus. 
If we strip the above-displayed videos of their captions, we can take a look purely at what the videos show. In one case, it looks like a person was the victim of a traffic accident. In another, it appears that a man suffered a head injury. But since these videos appeared online during heightened hysteria about an outbreak of an illness, it’s easy to see how a passerby may have made the assumption that these incidents were connected to the coronavirus. 
WHO explained that the coronavirus is a respiratory illness with symptoms such as “fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.” A WHO official also told us that “sudden collapses” would be “atypical” for this disease. While we have not been able to definitively determine what these videos show, it seems unlikely that these people collapsed on the street due to coronavirus. 
On Jan. 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus as a public health emergency: 
The new coronavirus has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China.
“The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems.
The death toll now stands at 170 people in China.
The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 countries outside of the country, but no deaths.

A viral social media post erroneously advised the public to ""keep your throat moist"" in order to avoid contracting the respiratory infection.
In January 2020 we received multiple inquiries from readers about an alert that was shared widely on Facebook and Twitter, purporting to be an “emergency notification” from an unspecified “Ministry of Health” about an ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus. 
Broadly speaking, the warning appeared in two forms. The most commonly shared was a text post that typically read as follows:
*Urgent: Health Bulletin to the Public *
*Ministry of health’s emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal. There’s no cure once you are infected.*
*Its spreading from China to various countries*
*Prevention method is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins.*
*Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age.* *Everytime u feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand.* *Do not drink plenty at one time as it doesn’t help, instead continue to keep throat moist.*
*Till end of March 2020, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation* *Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.*
*The symptoms/ description are*
*1.repeated high fever*
*2.prolonged coughing after fever*
*3.Children are prone*
*4.Adults usually feel uneasy,*headache and mainly respiratory related*
*5: highly contagious*

The message was typically followed up with an exhortation to share its warnings, such as, “Please forward to help others.” One version of the viral alert even concluded by pleading with readers, “Please share if you care for human life.” 
The second principal form in which the message appeared was as a photograph of a printed email, dated Jan. 28, 2020, and purporting to have been sent by “NWLLAB.” It contained many of the same key components — it purported to come from an unspecified “MOH” (Ministry of Health), and its main recommendation to the public was again to “keep your throat moist” by drinking water. It read as follows:
Pls tell ur families, relatives and friends
MOH Health Bulletin to the Public:
The Upper Respiratory Infection affecting China at present is quite serious. The virus causing it is very potent and is resistant to existing antibiotics. 
(virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics).
The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime [sic] you feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation. 
Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C. 
The symptoms/description are:
1. Repeated high fever.
2. Prolonged coughing after fever. 
3. Children are more prone. 
4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness. 
This illness is highly contagious. Let’s continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection. 
Please share. 

Neither the printed email nor the viral Facebook message were official statements produced by any public health authority. The alert was apt to spread widely online precisely because it did not include any details about its supposed source, aside from mentioning a “Ministry of Health” in an unspecified country or region. 
The message also contained erroneous advice, claiming that readers could avoid contracting the virus by “keeping your throat moist,” avoiding fried or spicy food, and taking vitamin-C supplements.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the so-called “novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)” outbreak is thought to have first been transmitted from animals to humans in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China. Since then, it has spread from person to person. Previous coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been transmitted between humans primarily through “respiratory droplets” ⁠— that is, coughs and sneezes. 
The CDC’s general respiratory infection prevention advice applies to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, as follows:


Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.


No evidence exists to indicate that any public health authority is officially advising the public that a dry throat makes individuals more vulnerable to contracting the virus, and that therefore drinking water is an effective prevention method, nor that vitamin C deficiency contributes to one’s vulnerability to contracting the illness, nor that fried and spicy food are a medium for transmission of 2019-nCoV.",FALSE

Some details from a mock health exercise were confused with real-world reports.
Amid growing public anxiety about an outbreak of a new coronavirus originating in China in late January 2020, various media outlets reported on a dire warning that suggested the virus could kill 65 million people annually. 
The Daily Mail, for example, reported that health experts had “predicted” the virus could kill 65 million people in a year. The publication later issued a correction and updated its article.
Such stories were prompted by a mock pandemic health exercise run by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security on Oct. 18, 2019. But that exercise did not “predict” the current virus would kill 65 million people.
Johns Hopkins released a statement countering the viral news stories (emphasis added):
In October 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic tabletop exercise called Event 201 with partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, coronaviruses are “a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS and SARS.”

On July 24, 2020, author Stephen King posted a message on Twitter that claimed the number of Americans who will perish as a result of COVID-19 will be twice the number of Americans who died during the Vietnam War by this fall: 

King was both right and wrong. The death toll in the United States from COVID-19 will indeed be more than twice the death toll from the Vietnam War by this fall, but it won’t take that long. In fact, as of this writing in July 2020, the COVID-19 death toll is already double the number of American deaths recorded for the Vietnam War. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) provisional count for deaths involving COVID-19 was 132,366 as of July 24, 2020. The CDC’s data, which often lags behind other sources by a week or so, is about 12,000 deaths lower than the John Hopkins University count of 144,780 COVID-19 related deaths.
In either case, both of these numbers are more than twice as high as the number of Americans who were killed in combat during the Vietnam War. According to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service in 2019, 58,220 American “in-theater” deaths were recorded for the Vietnam War. If we double this number, we get 116,440. 
We are, of course, unable to determine how many more people will die from COVID-19 by this fall. The CDC has published forecasts on the total number of deaths from this pandemic, but their estimates only go to mid-August. After assessing 26 individual forecasts from organizations researching the pandemic, the CDC estimated that the United States will see “between 160,000 and 175,000 total reported COVID-19 deaths by August 15.”
The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota reported on July 23 that the United States was seeing approximately 1,000 casualties per day from the pandemic. Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, said that if this trend continues the United States, could surpass 300,000 COVID-19 deaths by the end of the year.",mostly-true

Given the massive undertaking, Snopes readers asked whether this was true. The Chinese government apparently is endeavoring to do just that. Photographs show machinery starting to prepare construction at the site on Jan. 24, 2020. Within days, structures that would comprise the new hospital were already built.

Although the feat may sound unbelievable to some, it wouldn’t be the first time the Chinese government put up a hospital in lightning speed to deal with an outbreak. In 2003, Beijing built a hospital in one week to treat SARS patients.

From May 10, 2020, to June 27, 2020, 13 sisters from the same convent in Michigan died from COVID-19, prompting Snopes readers to ask if that particularly concentrated pandemic tragedy was true.
Sadly, it is true. Twelve sisters from Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Convent in Livonia, Michigan, died within 30 days of each other during an outbreak of the coronavirus disease between May 10 and June 10. Another sister died on June 27.
Suzanne English, executive director of mission advancement for the Felician Sisters of North America — the congregation that the sisters belonged to — told us in a statement that although not all 13 sisters were tested, their symptoms were “inline with COVID” amid the outbreak at the convent.
In the case of the final fatality on June 27, English said, “the Sister had been COVID-positive and while she had passed the 28-day quarantine, we believe it was the lingering effects that caused her death.”
Although some news reports referred to the women as “nuns,” English pointed out that because the Felicians are monastic (living under religious vows), they are correctly referred to as “sisters.”
A total of 30 sisters at the Livonia convent — of the 57 then living there — were infected. Seventeen recovered, English said in an email, citing Sister Noel Marie Gabriel, director of clinical health services for the Felicians.
According to Global Sisters Report, a news publication focusing on Catholic sisters and current events, the 13 sisters who passed were heavily involved in their community, performing services like working as nurses, educators, and librarians.
“That was our most tragic time,” Sister Gabriel told the publication. “It was a month of tragedy and sorrow and mourning and grieving.”

Throughout the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, countless social media posts, high profile pundits, and even the president attempted to downplay the threat of the virus in the U.S. in various ways, including comparing its death toll to that of the seasonal flu:

This claim is false and dangerously downplays the severity of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the 2018-19 influenza season resulted in an estimated 34,200 deaths in the U.S. As of July 27, 2020, more than 4.2 million COVID-19 cases had been reported across 50 states, seven territories and Washington, D.C., and more than 146,500 deaths were associated with the respiratory disease — nearly four times the death toll associated with the 2018-19 flu season.
Influenza impacts can vary widely from year to year and while the infection places a “substantial burden on the health of people in the U.S. every year,” estimated annual deaths caused by the flu over the last decade are significantly lower than COVID-19 deaths reported in the first seven months of 2020:
Source: CDC
The last influenza pandemic, caused by influenza A (H1N1), occurred in 2009. Nicknamed the “swine flu,” the global outbreak resulted in approximately 61 million cases, 274,000 hospitalizations, and 12,500 deaths in the U.S. over the following year, according to the National Library of Medicine.
Comparisons aside, experts warned that the U.S. will now see the impacts of COVID-19 alongside the next flu season, which will compound the difficulties faced by already overburdened hospitals and health care workers in many states.
“Even in non-pandemic years, influenza and other etiologies of pneumonia represent the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, and respiratory viruses are the most commonly identified pathogens among hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia,” wrote Dr. Benjamin Singer, a Northwestern Medicine pulmonologist who treats COVID-19 patients, in an editorial published in Science Advances.
Both the flu and COVID-19 can be severe respiratory diseases but they are caused by different types of viruses. The flu is caused by four types of influenza viruses (A, B, C, and D), whereas COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV-2, notes the CDC. The severity of infection by coronavirus or influenza is largely dependent on a number of factors, including underlying medical conditions and age. Both the flu and COVID-19 can have similar symptoms and health officials note that it is important to stay vigilant and practice proper hygiene and social distancing measures.",FALSE

Despite overwhelming evidence that mask use slows the spread of COVID-19, there has been continuous pushback on social media from those who oppose wearing these potentially life-saving face coverings. In July 2020, we came across a strange, new argument in this ongoing debate, as seen in the meme above: There’s no point in wearing a mask because the fumes of a fart can penetrate through underwear and pants, including denim jeans.
The meme is ambiguous but appears to be arguing at a minimum that 1.) since the odor of a fart can pass through denim, a deadly virus can penetrate through a cloth mask and/or 2.) that COVID-19 may be transmissible via a fart. We tease apart these assertions below.
Breathing vs. Farting
For starters, people breathe far more often than they fart. On average, a person takes about 20,000 breaths per day. Conversely, the average person farts between 5 and 15 times per day. If these were equally viable methods of COVID-19 transmission (which they are not, but we’ll address that later), it’s clear why health officials would focus more on getting the public to wear masks instead of pants. Clothing, of course, is already widely used (and, in fact, legally required) in public spaces. 
It should also be noted that masks, like pants, prevent droplet transmission. As we noted in a previous article, a number of simple demonstrations have been conducted by doctors, researchers, and even children’s televisions programs to show how using a face mask prevents droplet transmission. Here’s a look at a petri dish that was coughed on by a person wearing a mask (left) and a person not wearing a mask (right):
Twitter/Katie Corley
Believe it or not, a similar demonstration was conducted in 2001 in relation to farts. 
Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki, who has been dubbed by some as the Bill Nye of Australia, measured the winds of passing gas by having a lucky colleague fart onto two petri dishes, once while wearing pants, and again in the light of a full moon. 
Dr. Kruszelnicki then described the method by which he had established whether human flatus was germ-laden, or merely malodorous. “I contacted Luke Tennent, a microbiologist in Canberra, and together we devised an experiment. He asked a colleague to break wind directly onto two Petri dishes from a distance of 5 centimetres, first fully clothed, then with his trousers down. Then he observed what happened. Overnight, the second Petri dish sprouted visible lumps of two types of bacteria that are usually found only in the gut and on the skin. But the flatus which had passed through clothing caused no bacteria to sprout, which suggests that clothing acts as a filter.
In other words, wearing pants, like wearing a mask, can lessen droplet transmission. 
Can COVID-19 Be Transmitted Via Farts?
The claim that COVID-19 can spread via flatulence is largely based on a few academic studies that found the virus was present in the fecal matter of some infected persons. However, there have been no confirmed reports of COVID-19 being transmitted via fecal matter. 
In April 2020, the British tabloid The Daily Star lent credence to the idea that COVID-19 was spreading via farts when they published an article that was misleadingly entitled “Coronavirus ‘could be spreading across the globe through farts’ claim doctors.” This headline, however, did not reflect reality. The Star’s sub-heading, for instance, clarified that “infected people” could “wear pants” to prevent this theoretically plausible form of transmission from occurring. Furthermore, The Star later updated the headline of this article to note that this form of transmission was “unlikely.” 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes in an FAQ about COVID-19 that while the virus has truly been found in the fecal matter of infected persons, there have  been no confirmed reports about the disease spreading via fecal matter: 
The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
The above-displayed meme does not convey some sort of logical flaw that negates the purpose of wearing a mask to stop the spread of COVID-19. In fact, if you take the time to think about the claims in this meme, it may prove precisely the opposite. Would you rather be farted on by a fully clothed individual? Or by a naked person? In the same manner, a mask can prevent droplet transmission, slow the spread of COVID-19, and, like pants, at the very least it can lessen the overall grossness factor.",FALSE

Media outlets in late July 2020 circulated reports that taller people may be at a higher risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. The news came as much of the world continued to see increasing infection rates, and many economies were considering either reopening or extending lockdown measures.
This claim is unproven. No conclusive scientific evidence exists linking height to COVID-19 infection, and the study referred to by news publications has not been peer-reviewed. 
The unpublished study made available in advance of its publication date found “weak” evidence linking a person’s height with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, and those who stand 6 feet and taller were found more likely to contract the virus. The study findings were posted on July 15, 2020, in the preprint server medRxiv, which means that the findings have not been peer-reviewed or published in any academic journal. Though early releases of research can provide important and relevant findings that help to inform further research, they should not be used to guide clinical practice or be taken as scientific. (You can learn more about preprint publications here.) 
Using a five-minute survey, the study aimed to identify “work-related and personal factors that contribute to or could limit the spread of the virus.” The authors, in a speculative statement, suggest that a relationship between height and risk might stem from the importance of aerosol transmission over droplet transmission.",FALSE
2326.0,Bay leaves contain a compound that decreases anxiety when burned.,"Will Burning Bay Leaves Reduce Anxiety?
A chemical compound found in the leaves of the bay laurel may affect mood, but the results are inconclusive and not necessarily relevant to bay leaf smoke.
One of the more popular topics on web sites that advocate for “natural” cures is the cornucopia of purported benefits ascribed in some way to leaves from the bay laurel (Laurus nobilis). Blender spokesperson and gravity skeptic David “Avocado” Wolfe, who runs a pseudoscientific alternative health and supplement empire, made this claim about burning the leaves on a widely shared post on his eponymous web site:

The bay leaf contains a compound called linalool. A study by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists found that linalool decreases anxiety and enhances social interaction.
In as little as 10 minutes of smelling a burning bay leaf, linalool begins working. Some have even described the effect as mildly psychedelic.

It is interesting that Wolfe selected this specific article to support the assertion that burning a bay leaf works to reduce anxiety, as that study actually concluded — using laboratory rats — that while linalool can decrease motor function and essentially knock a rat unconscious at excessive doses, it does not appear to have a strong anti-anxiety effect:

Our data did not support anxiolytic [anti-anxiety] effects of linalool in the rat model, they suggested that linalool modulates the central nervous system by producing unconsciousness and degradation of motor movements.

That does not mean, however, that there were a dearth of papers Wolfe could have selected that suggest a connection between linalool and anxiety, merely that his review of the scientific literature appears to have been both extremely superficial and largely incomplete. Linalool is a major component of many aromatic plants, most notably lavender, and it has been the subject of a number of different areas of research.
A better study (in terms of results but not necessarily methodology) for Wolfe would have been a 2010 paper published in the journal Phytomedicine, which suggested (using laboratory mice and pure linalool vapors) that linalool may have an effect on anxiety:

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inhaled linalool on anxiety, aggressiveness and social interaction in mice. […] Inhaled linalool showed anxiolytic properties in the light/dark test, increased social interaction and decreased aggressive behavior […]. These results strengthen the suggestion that inhaling linalool rich essential oils can be useful as a mean to attain relaxation and counteract anxiety.

The light/dark box test, which investigates how quickly a laboratory mouse leaves a dark space to explore a novel light space, is a controversial method to assess anxiety, however, as it is prone to false positives and many do not consider it an accurate analog for human anxiety. This test was also performed in other animal studies related to anxiety and linalool that provide evidence for a connection.
In terms of human studies, a study published in the journal Human Psychopharmacology in 2009 reported results from the administration of lavender capsules (which, again, contain linalool) to 97 individuals while showing them a combination of “neutral” and “anxiety-producing” films. They concluded:

Lavender has anxiolytic effects in humans under conditions of low anxiety, but these effects may not extend to conditions of high anxiety.

Whatever one’s reservations are about the methodology employed here, it is important to note that lavender capsules are not bay leaf vapors, even though both likely contain linalool. Lavender oil contains between 25 to 38 percent linalool, whereas the oil derived from bay leaves contain around 4 to 6 percent linalool, and ingestion versus inhalation involve different processes in the body. It is also important to distinguish between the overall effect of smelling a pleasant aroma such as bay leaf smoke or lavender vapors, which can have a general effect on mood, from the specific biochemical mechanism by which substances may affect mood.
Rachel Hertz, a professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University who has studied the interplay between mood and smell extensively, explained in a piece for Scientific American that the most obvious mood-scent link is through associative learning, which she says is especially powerful for the sense of smell:

Odors do affect people’s mood, work performance and behavior in a variety of ways but it isn’t because odors work on us like a drug, instead we work on them through our experiences with them. […]
In olfaction, the process can be understood as follows: a novel odor is experienced in the context of an unconditioned stimulus, such as surgical procedure in a hospital, which elicits an unconditioned emotional response, such as anxiety. The odor then becomes a conditioned stimulus for that hospital experience and acquires the ability to elicit the conditioned response of anxiety when encountered in the future. This mechanism explains both how odors come to be liked or disliked, as well as how they can elicit emotions and moods.
Teasing apart this kind of effect from from any more specific biochemical method is challenging, and none of the research on linalool or lavender oil is adequate to address the possibility that bay leaf smoke could have a marked effect on anxiety. As such, we rank the claim that bay leaf combustion serves to reduce anxiety as unproven.",FALSE

In July 2020, social media users posted a meme that included a screenshot of an article excerpt that allegedly demonstrated hydroxychloroquine would be an effective “cure and vaccine” against COVID-19. 
The claim stems from an opinion piece by Bryan Fischer, former director of the American Family Association, that interpreted a 2005 study on the utility of chloroquine to treat SARS as being relevant to COVID-19 — a disease that did not exist at the time of that paper’s publication. SARS (aka SARS-CoV, which caused epidemics in the early 2000s) and COVID-19 (aka SARS-CoV-2) are both caused by coronaviruses, but that does not mean that both could be treated with the same medication. 
Similarly, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are related drugs, but that does not mean they are interchangeable. Finally, the excerpted study was limited in scope and based on laboratory results. Fischer attempted to tie Dr. Anthony Fauci to the 2005 study by falsely alleging that it was published in a journal run by the U.S. agency Fauci heads.

Are SARS and COVID-19 the same? No.
While SARS and COVID-19 are both coronaviruses, that does not mean these two diseases are interchangeable, nor that they can be treated with identical medicines.
Hundreds of coronaviruses exist, most of which circulate among animals. These viruses occasionally jump to humans and cause diseases that range in severity. The common cold, for instance, which isn’t particularly known for being lethal, can be caused by a coronavirus. On the other hand, COVID-19, which has caused more than 150,000 deaths in the United States (and close to 700,000 total deaths worldwide) as of this writing, is also caused by a coronavirus. Nobody would argue that a treatment for the common cold would be equally effective against COVID-19.  
Fischer attempts to dismiss the fact that SARS and COVID-19 are two distinct diseases by arguing that they share a similar scientific name (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) and 79% of the same genome. Saying that these two diseases share 79% of their genome sequence may make it sound like these diseases are nearly identical, but consider this: Humans share 98% of our genome with chimpanzees. 
Are hydroxycloroquine and chloroquine the same thing? No.
Although these drugs are similar (they are both derivatives of a 4-aminoquinoline [4AQ] nucleus), they aren’t interchangeable. Chloroquine is primarily used to treat malaria, while hydroxychloroquine, which is considered less toxic than chloroquine, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and certain blood disorders. 
CNN writes:
Chloroquine is used to treat malaria, as well as in chemoprophylaxis, which is the administering of drugs to prevent the development of disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2006, it has not been recommended for use in severe malaria because of problems with resistance, particularly in the Oceania region, according to the World Health Organization.
[…]
Hydroxychloroquine is what’s known as an analog of chloroquine, meaning the two have similar structures but different chemical and biological properties. The former is considered the less toxic derivative, according to studies.
It’s given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and the blood disorder porphyria cutanea tarda, the CDC said.
Did this study prove that chloroquine was an effective treatment against SARS? No.
The 2005 article published in Virology Journal was based on a laboratory cell-culture experiment that used primate cells, not human cells. The authors noted at the time that more testing was needed before antivirals could be developed to treat the disease in humans:
Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [15]. Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease.
It should also be noted that this was an in vitro study, meaning that it was conducted in a controlled environment, like a test tube, not inside a living organism. The Universal Health Network, a medical research organization in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, noted that in vitro models have a reputation of being “less translatable” to humans than other research methods:
A major drawback is their failure to capture the inherent complexity of organ systems. For example, in vitro models may not account for interactions between cells and biochemical processes that occur during turnover and metabolism. As a result, in vitro studies have developed a reputation for being “less translatable” to humans.
More importantly, in the years since the SARS outbreak in 2002, chloroquine has not been widely used to treat the disease. 
Did this study say that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment against SARS? No. 
The 2005 paper in the Virology Journal never mentions hydroxychloroquine.
Was Fauci or the NIH involved in this 2005 paper? No. 
As mentioned earlier, the above-displayed screenshot shows an excerpt from an opinion piece written by Fischer, which was published on websites such as One News Now and the conspiratorial True Pundit, a site that traffics in misinformation. 
Fischer’s article is centered on a 2005 paper published in the Virology Journal entitled “Chloroquine Is a Potent Inhibitor of SARS Coronavirus Infection and Spread.” Although this is a genuine article, it was not authored by Fauci. Fischer attempted to connect Fauci to this article by stating that the “Virology Journal [is] the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health [NIH],” but that simply isn’t true. The Virology Journal is not an official publication of the NIH. 
The Virology Journal is published by Biomed Central (BMC), part of the publishing group Springer Nature, an academic publishing company. Some government researchers were involved with this 2005 study (five of the eight listed authors were from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the other three were from Clinical Research Institute of Montreal), but this study did not involve Fauci or anyone else from the NIH.
Is hydroxychloroquine an effective treatment for COVID-19? No. 
As of this writing, hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to be an effective treatment of COVID-19. 
Hydroxychloroquine has been an effective treatment for other diseases, such as malaria, but studies have not found the drug to be useful in the fight against COVID-19. In June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked “the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19,” writing that a large, randomized clinical trial showed that the drug provided “no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery.”",FALSE

During the spring and summer of 2020, multiple readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of news articles that claimed two school boys in China had died suddenly during physical exercise while each wearing a face mask, as part of broader efforts to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. 
On May 6, the New York Post published an article with the headline “Two Boys Drop Dead in China While Wearing Masks During Gym Class,” while the Australian television network 7News reported that:
“Two schoolboys have died within a week of one another while taking part in compulsory physical education examinations while wearing face masks in China. Major Chinese cities and provinces are moving to cancel this term’s running tests amid concerns over student fitness following three months of lockdown and school closures.
“Possible breathing difficulties during the exam while mask-wearing remains mandatory in the absence of a vaccine have also led to the decision, reports said. It comes after two 14-year-old boys ‘suddenly’ collapsed on their school running track and were subsequently declared dead in the county of Dancheng in Henan Province and the city of Changsha in Hunan Province — both in Central China.”
The Daily Mail published a similar report on May 4. 
Those reports contained a high degree of accuracy, although some misrepresented the respective ages of the boys. The deaths were widely reported in China in May 2020, providing corroboration of the following core facts.
On April 24, a 15-year-old boy given the pseudonym Xiao Li died after collapsing during gym class at Caiyuan Middle School in Henan Province. (His age was incorrectly given as 14 years old in articles by the New York Post and 7News). On April 30, a 14-year-old boy at the Xiangjun Future Experimental School in Hunan Province died after collapsing during a running drill in gym class. 
According to one report, educational authorities in several Chinese provinces introduced new guidelines in late April and early May, apparently in response to the deaths, instructing schools not to force students to wear a mask while exercising (but to maintain distancing between students), as well as avoiding conducting gym class at or around noon. 
Although we found ample corroboration of the circumstances surrounding the boys’ deaths, it’s not clear whether their wearing face masks was a contributing factor in their deaths, or merely a coincidence.
On May 4, the state-run People’s Daily reported that the family of the boy who died on April 24 had refused to agree to an autopsy, meaning a definitive conclusion could not be reached about the cause or causes of his death. According to other reports, an autopsy was not performed in relation to the death on April 30, either. 
The English-language reports mentioned above rightly did not claim with any certainty that the boys’ wearing face masks was what had killed them, and all three carried quotations from Cao Lanxiu, a professor at Shanxi University, in the city of Taiyuan. Cao told Chinese news media that she believed it was unlikely the wearing of the face masks was any more than coincidental in the boys’ deaths.",mostly-true

A series of social media posts widely circulated in August 2020 claimed that Legionnaires’ disease, a respiratory infection that can cause a rare and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia, could be contracted from reused face masks worn to protect against COVID-19.
Snopes readers asked us to verify this rumor that essentially argues respiratory droplets containing Legionella pneumophila, the pathogen that causes Legionnaires’ disease, may persist in those contaminated respiratory droplets held within a used mask. Specifically, the social media posts stated that the “moisture and bacteria” found in an anonymous woman’s mask, which she wore daily, resulted in a misdiagnosis of COVID-19.
Mask wearers beware …
A caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these “spikes” in COVID are really something else due to improper mask wearing??
Copied and pasted
The claim in the social media post is false.
According to Legionella, a nonprofit organization that shares educational material and scientific research about the disease, Legionnaires’ is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by infected persons or their masks.
“You cannot contract Legionnaires’ disease from wearing face masks. Legionella bacterium is transmitted by aspirating drinking water or breathing in water droplets. Legionella is not spread from person-to-person in respiratory droplets nor does the bacteria survive on dry surfaces. Your mask would not be a source of transmission for the Legionella bacteria,” wrote the organization on its website.
Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of lung infection caused by breathing in mist or water that is contaminated with the bacterium. The condition is characterized by a cough, fever, headache, and shortness of breath — all symptoms that are also associated with COVID-19 and could potentially result in the misdiagnosis. Though Legionnaires’ is treatable with antibiotics, about 1-in-10 infected people will die.
However, as noted by Legionella, if a person were diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, it would not be a consequence of wearing a mask. Water contaminated with the bacteria must be directly inhaled or drank by an individual in order to become infected. As such, a mask would theoretically need to come into direct contact with contaminated water in order for it to be inhaled. Even so, Legionella only grows in standing water under warm temperatures and cannot survive on dry surfaces.

In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance for reopening buildings after widespread and abrupt COVID-19 shutdowns of businesses, schools, and other facilities. Those closures resulted in decreased water usage, which could contribute to pooling in water systems that are prime locations for the growth of Legionella bacterium. Combined with shutdown-related declines in water chlorination and regular cleaning, the agency noted that the bacteria may accumulate in standing water over the course of weeks or months before being aerosolized through devices like showers, hot tubs, fountains, and air conditioning cooling towers used once localities reopen.
Snopes could find no mention of the radio show referenced in the Facebook posts, but we did track down an article published by the Naples Daily News Editorial Board that reported on a rumor of four Floridians who had been diagnosed with mask-related Legionnaires’ disease at a local hospital. The hospital’s CEO Paul Hiltz told Naples Daily News he knew of no such cases.
A 2017 case study described a 67-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease after failing to clean the mask, tubing, and humidifier of her continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine used for sleep apnea, which suggests that there may be a link between plastic facial masks directly connected to contaminated water systems. However, CPAP masks are generally made of hard plastic with a silicone seal and not the same material as standard cloth filter masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The CDC cautions that people at risk for Legionnaire’s disease, such as those with weakened immune systems and previous smokers, should consult with a doctor before they flush toilets that have not been used recently or perform any sort of cleaning activities that might result in the production of aerosols. In fact, the agency notes that the use of purifying face masks may help to limit the risk of infection.

In the summer of 2020, Snopes readers inquired about the accuracy of widely circulated Facebook posts that claimed some ingredients in common sunscreens can be absorbed into the bloodstream and pose neurological threats to children. One claim in particular was shared thousands of times. That post by a Florida mother alleged that chemicals in her infant daughter’s sunscreen may have been connected to “weird episodes” of “zoning out” and “dropping [of] her head,” which could have led to petit mal seizures, a temporary and sudden loss of consciousness also known as absence seizures. 

Some elements of this claim are true, while other points are either unproven or misleading. Research has indicated that active ingredients found in sunscreen can be absorbed into the body’s bloodstream after application. However, the neurological effects of these ingredients remain poorly understood and understudied. 
Understanding Different Types of Sunscreens
According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, consumers can choose from two types of sunscreen: chemical sunscreens that work like a sponge to absorb the sun’s rays, and physical sunscreens that act as a shield for the skin. Physical or mineral sunscreens generally consist of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, both of which are known for their chalky appearance when applied to the skin. Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, typically contain the chemicals oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate, and octinoxate that reduce the white, pasty appearance.
In the United States, sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug and is monitored and enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By and large, most sunscreen products were approved before the modern, governmental standardization of drug evaluation and approval processes, requiring that drug manufacturers prove the safety and efficacy of their own products. As such, sunscreens have not been subject to rigorous drug safety testing, according to a 2014 panel held by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Evidence that sunscreen can be absorbed into the body was first presented in 1997, and subsequent research has further indicated this to be true. A study published in 2008 in coordination with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey — an ongoing nationwide survey to collect data on the health of Americans — found that 97% of urine samples collected as part of a national health survey contained the sunscreen ingredient oxybenzone.
The Babyganics Sunscreen Controversy
The 2020 social media posts came five years after a class-action lawsuit was filed against Babyganics, a skincare company that was sued for allegedly misrepresenting some of its baby products, including sunscreen, as “natural” and having a misleading ingredient list. According to Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit advertising watchdog organization, Babyganics was accused of violating state laws regarding how a company is allowed to market its products. The suit was settled out of court for $2.2 million, according to Business Wire.
In an email, Babyganics told Snopes that octinoxate was removed from the SPF 50 lotion ingredient list in 2015 due to its potential effects on ocean reefs. That said, many Babyganic lotions still contain octisalate and octocrylene — two ingredients currently listed as chemicals to be considered for further safety and efficacy review by the FDA. The company went on to address Rackley’s viral claims in an Instagram post dated June 25, 2020.
We want you to know that the FDA regulates all sunscreens, including ours, to make sure they meet safety and effectiveness standards. We have chosen the active sunscreen ingredients in our products because the FDA believes, based on the available science, that they are safe and effective.
Following the lawsuit, the FDA proposed a rule in February 2019 that would bring sunscreen regulations up-to-date with scientific understanding of the effects of some ingredients, as part of an ongoing review of over-the-counter products. In particular, the agency requested further research to investigate the extent to which the skin absorbs ingredients, and whether that absorption has any effect on the skin or body.
“It’s a high priority for the FDA, and we continue to work toward establishing final marketing requirements for sunscreens. As part of this rule, the FDA has asked industry and other interested parties for additional safety data on 12 active sunscreen ingredients currently available in marketed products,” wrote the FDA in a news release. 
A proposed rule is the first step in the regulatory process and asks interested parties to submit comments and deliver a monograph — or “recipe book” — detailing the safety and efficacy of all ingredients included in products. Any sunscreen that contains active ingredients not listed in the monograph must go through a New Drug Application process and cannot be sold until it has been approved. Snopes contacted the FDA to determine whether the final monograph was submitted by its Nov. 26, 2019, deadline, and which chemicals were included in its pages. We will update this article as soon as we receive a response.
As part of its review, the FDA will determine which sunscreen ingredients are “generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) and not misbranded.”

Does Absorption Equal Risk?
A first step in the FDA review to provide a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of certain sunscreen ingredients included a study conducted by agency researchers that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in January 2020. The study described how six of the most commonly used active ingredients found in sunscreen (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, and octinoxate) can be absorbed into the body’s bloodstream after application. Results from the study show suggest that some sunscreen active ingredients may be absorbed. The 2020 results build on findings from a pilot study published in May 2019, which found four active ingredients (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, and ecamsule) were absorbed through the skin and into the body when sunscreen was used at its maximum dosage.
A JAMA editorial in response to the 2019 study co-written by Dr. Robert Califf and Dr. Kanade Shinkai noted that while systemic absorption was considered “well above the FDA guidelines,” that didn’t necessarily mean sunscreen was unsafe. However, it does “raise many important questions about sunscreen” and the processes for its evaluation and approval, particularly when weighing the benefits against the risks in children.
” … The fact that an ingredient is absorbed through the skin and into the body does not mean that the ingredient is unsafe, nor does the FDA seeking further information indicate such. Rather, this finding calls for further industry testing to determine the safety and effect of systemic exposure of sunscreen ingredients, especially with chronic use,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement.
In short, the FDA still contends that “absorption does not equal risk,” and the proposed rule is meant to provide “additional safety studies to fill in the current data gaps for these ingredients.”
Generally speaking, no evidence exists to suggest that current doses of ingredients found in common sunscreens are “neurotoxic” or result in epilepsy. However, a 2017 review published in the journal Toxicology Reports found that some adverse neurotoxic effects of chemicals used in sunscreen may occur “at concentrations substantially higher than those observed in environment and human tissues,” which could offer insight into such conditions in sensitive populations and potentially lend further insight into dosage recommendations. In particular, the review found potential neurotoxic effects of ingredients in both chemical and physical sunscreens, including octocrylene, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide — three chemicals reported in the Babyganics ingredients list, noted the monthly publication Practical Dermatology.
The research published in Toxicology Reports found potential links between common sunscreen ingredients and endocrinological issues, impairment of gene expression and regulation, and reproductive issues, among others. It is important to note that many of the studies included in the review analyzed the implications of environmental exposure to the chemicals in large doses on animals, both in controlled and uncontrolled environments, and did not necessarily look at the impact directly on humans at chemical levels seen in sunscreen. Snopes contacted the American Neurological Association for further clarification and will update the article accordingly.
While the FDA continues to review the short- and long-term effects of certain sunscreen ingredients, experts recommend continuing to use sunscreen and other sun-protective measures.",mixture

A recurring bit of pandemic misinformation alleges that COVID-19 is not caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or, for that matter, any virus at all. Despite voluminous evidence that COVID-19 is a viral infection, this claim —  or aspects of it — persist online. In general, the same flawed pseudoscientific argument has been employed in multiple instances to suggest that COVID-19 — with over 20 million cases and a death toll of over 160,000 at the time of this reporting — is just a big classification error.
The claim that went viral on several social media platforms blends the misinterpretation of a preliminary and unpublished research paper with the baseless assertion that the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that no autopsies be performed on COVID-19 victims — a paranoid flourish used to imply a global conspiracy. By ignoring this alleged ban, the story goes, Italian doctors revealed that COVID-19 was actually a bacteria, and that, for some reason, aspirin can cure the disease.
The only factual element of the above narrative is that Italian researchers analyzed autopsy results of COVID-19 patients. They published a preprint of a research study based on post-mortem lung analyses of 38 patients in two Italian hospitals in April 2020. That study, which explicitly stated that COVID-19 is caused by coronavirus, suggested that a condition known as Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) was the “predominant” feature of all of the cases. This potential finding was notable since pneumonia was thought to be the primary factor leading to death in COVID-19 cases at the time. While it is a general medical term used to describe a damaging immune and blood-clotting response to a lung injury, DAD is not a disease, but instead a condition potentially caused by a variety of diseases. 
That finding — along with the presence of clotting cells known as “platelet-fibrin thrombi” in the patients’ lungs — suggested to the authors that preventing complications from blood clotting (coagulopathy) could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments. After this paper was uploaded to the preprint server MedRxiv, misinformation followed.
An inaccurate copypasta description of this study from mid-May interpreted those results as evidence that Covid-19 stemmed from “a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,” that death from the disease stems from thrombosis (or blood clotting), and that the COVID-19 “ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.” This is how aspirin entered the zeitgeist. As a drug with anticoagulant properties, it could theoretically be employed to reduce complications from thrombosis.
Perhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection.
“Breaking Covid news!” began a loosely intelligible bit of copypasta from late May, “Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium.” These results were only possible, viral claims now asserted, because Italian doctors had defied a WHO ban on autopsies.
It is unclear how the notion that a ban on autopsies was instituted by the WHO first emerged. As British fact-checking outlet Full Fact pointed out when the claim first went viral, “the WHO released guidance on [March 24 2020] on safety measures for managing bodies and performing post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19.” Numerous studies have published post-mortem analyses of Covid patients, including some that predate the Italian study.
On top of that, there is no actual scientific debate regarding the viral origins of COVID-19, which was linked to a coronavirus even in the earliest public reports from China. Scientists have isolated and mapped SARS-CoV-2’s entire genome based on samples taken from infected humans. Billions of dollars have been invested into finding a vaccine against it based on science’s understanding of the basic fact that a coronavirus caused this pandemic.
Despite the myriad factual hurdles one must leap over to label COVID-19 a bacterial infection, the claim (based on this same paper) persists. Some versions of the Italian autopsy story have been used to make an even more dubious assertion that the bacteria allegedly causing COVID-19 are “amplified by 5G.” This claim, despite still being pushed by snake oil salesmen like David “Avocado” Wolfe, comes from a study that was retracted because its authors were found to have manipulated the peer-review process to get it published.",FALSE

As the world continued to grapple with changing restrictions and recommendations surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, rumors persisted into late summer 2020 regarding scientific understanding behind the effectiveness of certain face coverings used to reduce COVID-19 transmission. In August, a number of news publications reported findings from Duke University research and claimed wearing “neck gaiters” — stretchy, thin articles of clothing worn around the neck to sometimes cover the face — can be worse for transmission than foregoing a mask altogether.
Our research found this claim to be false and largely misreported by some media outlets.
The claim can be traced back to a study published in Science Advances on Aug. 7, 2020. Throughout the course of their research, scientists set out to determine the best methods for testing how to evaluate 14 types of face coverings — not determine which one is the most effective in protecting against transmission. The study was not meant to be a conclusive guide describing which masks to wear, but rather how to test their varied effectiveness. Results regarding the effectiveness of any particular face covering were merely a byproduct of the study.
Science Advances
A simple and cost-effective method for testing the efficacy of certain face coverings is thought to be a crucial element to furthering the understanding of how SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, is spread. To that end, the research team turned to optical imaging in order to “highlight stark differences in the effectiveness of different masks and mask alternatives” that may help stop the spread of respiratory droplets, which are known to contain SARS-CoV-2 and can transmit during “regular speech.”
Furthermore, as of mid-2020, there was still much to be determined about the infection pathways of COVID-19, the route of transmission, how to properly use a mask, and how the virus may be affected by environmental variables.
For the proof-of-concept study, which is meant to inform future research, a person wearing a mask stood inside of a dark enclosure and spoke into the direction of a laser beam. Respiratory droplets were visible as they scattered light from the laser beam that a cell phone camera recorded. A simple computer algorithm then counted the droplets. Masks tested included a fitted N95 mask both with and without valves, surgical masks, different variations of polyester or cotton masks, as well as a bandana, and neck fleece, or gaiter. These were then compared against respiratory droplets emitted by a person who wore no face covering.
In short, the study findings concluded that the laser-beam method for viewing, recording, and counting respiratory droplets from analyzed face coverings is a quick and easy way to test their effectiveness. But how well each mask worked was not determined —– that would require further, more specific, evaluation, stricter testing mechanisms, and greater control over variables. Now, other scientists can use this same laser-beam method to specifically test for mask effectiveness.





A fitted N95 mask was determined to be the most effective, since just .1% of droplets were transmitted. A gaiter, on the other hand, was shown to disperse larger droplets into smaller ones, resulting in a higher droplet count than any other face covering and, indeed, than even foregoing a face mask altogether.
“We noticed that speaking through some masks (particularly the neck fleece) seemed to disperse the largest droplets into a multitude of smaller droplets, which explains the apparent increase in droplet count relative to no mask in that case,” wrote the researchers. “Considering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive.”
Science Advances
Katherine Ellen Foley, a health and science reporter at Quartz, pointed out in a Twitter thread that the research is not without limitations. For starters, test subjects were just talking and not sneezing, coughing, or breathing heavily. Furthermore, the study counted the number of droplets transmitted through each mask — a finding that does not necessarily equate to risk. In all, the research was meant to inform attempts to improve training on proper mask use to determine the safety and efficacy of reusing some masks.
“This was just a demonstration — more work is required to investigate variations in masks, speakers, and how people wear them — but it demonstrates that this sort of test could easily be conducted by businesses and others that are providing masks to their employees or patrons,” said study author Martin Fischer, Ph.D., a chemist and physicist and director of the Advanced Light Imaging and Spectroscopy facility, in a Duke University news release.
Then there is the argument regarding mask material. The researchers only tested gaiters made from fleece. However, different fabrics or materials — like polyester or cotton — could influence how effective a gaiter is in reducing transmission.
Outside experts contended headlines misrepresented the findings by saying that it’s better to wear no mask than a neck gaiter. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear masks in public settings and when around people outside of their household, citing evidence that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 and spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.
“If everyone wore a mask, we could stop up to 99% of these droplets before they reach someone else,” said Duke University physician Eric Westman. “In the absence of a vaccine or antiviral medicine, it’s the one proven way to protect others as well as yourself.”",FALSE

7144.554131,A photograph shows vintage box of fake snow decor made of the carcinogen asbestos.,"Was Fake Snow Made from Asbestos Marketed as Christmas Decor?
Asbestos was widely used for a variety of purposes before it was recognized as a significant carcinogen.
As Christmas 2017 approached, social media users began circulating an image of a vintage-looking box labeled “Asbestos: Pure White Fire Proof Snow” and questioning if the packaging really contained artificial snow made out of what is now a widely-recognized carcinogen:

In the early half of the 20th Century, asbestos was widely used as Christmas decor because of its white, fluffy appearance — but that was before the substance was recognized as a major risk factor for an aggressive form of cancer known as mesothelio, as the Asbestos.com website reports:
Asbestos was once marketed as artificial snow and sprinkled on trees and wreaths and ornaments. Although those products have not been produced for many years, the oldest decorations that were passed down from one generation to the next, may still have small amounts of asbestos.
The most famous asbestos snow scene was used during the filming of “The Wizard of Oz,” the 1939 classic with Judy Garland that became the most watched film in history. There is a scene in the movie where snow, made from asbestos, falls on Dorothy and her friends, awakening them from a spell cast by the Wicked Witch of the West.
The above displayed above depicts a real item sold to consumers in the mid-20th century. The picture was taken by Tony Rich, an industrial hygienist and amateur photographer who catalogs asbestos images on the photo-sharing platform Flickr using the moniker Asbestos Hunter. Rich, an anti-asbestos activist, originally shot the picture in 2009.
Rich told us he has the actual box in storage and directed us to another photograph that shows the product was manufactured by National Tinsel Manufacturing Company and sold in the late 1940s through the 1950s:
This brand actually contains amphibole asbestos “amosite”, very toxic.
Generally speaking, asbestos was used by the tens of millions of tons for nearly over a century and a half in modern history for a wide variety of applications, mostly due to its fire resistance, insulating properties, durability/strength, inertness, could be woven, and was cheap and abundant.
Major asbestos manufacturers had large [research and development] programs constantly finding new ways to use asbestos. I believe the most tragic use was in cigarette filters.
Rich told us many people are surprised to learn that, despite its significant link to cancer, asbestos isn’t completely banned in the United States. Aside from raising awareness with his camera as “Asbestos Hunter,” Rich serves on the Prevention Advisory Board for the non-profit Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO), on whose blog he wrote in 2015:
The United States has a very long history of asbestos usage, a tragic history that continues to be written to this day, to the ultimate detriment of its citizens…our loved ones, neighbors, and future generations.
During that time, tens of millions of tons of asbestos materials were put into our nation’s buildings and infrastructure, most of which remains in place today.
Eventually, laws and regulations were created in an attempt to help protect employees and the public from the toxic legacy left by asbestos. However, despite the volumes of asbestos standards, many still face ongoing problems related to regulatory under-enforcement, poor risk management or by simply failing to identify basic asbestos hazards.
Compounding these issues, asbestos continues to be imported into our country, primarily due to the alarming fact that asbestos has not yet been completely banned. Further, asbestos has been repeatedly found in a wide variety of new consumer products as reported by recent independent studies. Some of these asbestos-containing products include children’s toys and crayons, readily available from retail marketplace’s shelves.",TRUE

5661.0,"Chinese officials are seeking approval to start the mass killing of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of new coronavirus.","Is China Seeking Approval to Kill 20,000 Coronavirus Patients?
A disreputable website spread unfounded claims in the wake of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On Feb. 5, 2020, the website AB-TC (aka City News) published an article that claimed Chinese officials were seeking approval from the Supreme People’s Court to start the mass killing of 20,000 people infected with the new coronavirus in an attempt to contain the disease: 
China seek for court’s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus
The highest level of court in Chhina [sic], Supreme People’s Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.
The State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.
This is not a genuine news report. While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet’s reporting. 
For starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, “BREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.” But Shurmur didn’t die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.
The website has also published hoax articles about “cannibal restaurants” (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.
This website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:
Corrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News’ website
On 30 Jan 2020, a website called ‘City News’ published an article titled “BREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now” (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.
As of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.
None of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person’s byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called “local correspondents.” 
In other words, this website doesn’t exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting. 
In addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC’s article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a “document” or a “press conference,” they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that “the state” or “the court” or an “official” made a statement, but doesn’t provide any direct quotes or names in its report. 
Lastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China “ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.” That report, of course, made no mention of “mass killings.”
There is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China website.  
AB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we’ve concluded that this report is indeed false.",FALSE

In February 2020, the claim that rapper Eminem (Marshall Mathers) had been diagnosed with new coronavirus attracted attention on social media:
BREAKING: Eminem becomes the first celebrity to be diagnosed with Coronavirus.
Clearly some people did not read past the headline. While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem’s health quickly registered here at Snopes. 
Eminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem’s lyrics. We’re not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.
Here’s how this joke appeared on the “Dad Jokes” section of Reddit:
“In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti”
If this “news” story sounds a bit familiar, it’s because the text borrows heavily from Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.” The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:
“His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There’s vomit on his sweater already, mom’s spaghetti”
Here’s a video of the song from the movie “8 Mile”:

In September 2020, as the U.S. death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic rose above 200,000, a video supposedly showing an oddly prescient public service announcement (PSA) from the 1950s about “avoiding futures plagues” started going viral on social media:





This is not a genuine PSA from the 1950s. This video was created circa March 2020, and combines modern-day narration with a mash-up of archival footage. For example, one clip of a woman sipping from a cup was taken from the 1956 film “Tornado,” and the images of the house cleaning robot comes from the 1940s film “Leave It to Roll-Oh.”





The biggest tell, however, comes in the final moments of this so-called PSA.
After making some suspiciously prescient comments — this fake PSA says that the world will face a new plague in 2020 — the film cuts to a commercial about Doeskin Napkins. (Interestingly, the Doeskin Napkins commercial appears to be real, and refers to a genuine product.)
When the PSA returns, the narrator informs the viewer that they are about to be told the “answer about how to avoid the deadly virus set to sweep the world.” Then, in a humorous turn of events, the video cuts to a screen that says “missing footage” before a second screen shows that this is the end of the PSA. 
This viral video is not a genuine PSA about avoiding the future plague, and was created as a joke. This video was made by YouTube user “RamsesThePigeon,” and the original upload was accompanied by a caption explaining that they “threw this together” from archival and public domain footage.
It’s hilarious to look back on what people from the 1950s thought the future would be like!

Misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak seems to have traveled farther than the virus itself.
In early 2020, an outbreak of new coronavirus in Wuhan, China, sparked fears that the virus could cause a pandemic. It also inspired a significant amount of misinformation.
For example, on Feb. 17, 2020, the website Cityscrollz.com falsely reported that a Cameroonian college student studying in China contracted coronavirus but recovered “because of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of subsaharan Africans.”
If such a claim, that people from African backgrounds are more resistant to coronavirus than others, were true, one would expect it to be a major news story. Instead, it’s being reported exclusively in viral social media posts and junk sites. That’s because it’s not true.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected with the coronavirus is at risk for contracting it.
That said, it is true that Kem Senou Pavel Daryl, a 21-year-old Cameroon national studying in China, became ill after contracting coronavirus and was hospitalized. His recovery was not the result of a superior immune system possessed by people hailing from African countries but, according to news reports, rounds of antibiotics and other drugs.
As BBC News reported, Senou recovered after being placed in isolation for 13 days. “The CT scan showed no trace of the illness. He became the first African person known to be infected with the deadly coronavirus and the first to recover. His medical care was covered by the Chinese state.”
As of this writing, the coronavirus outbreak has killed 1,770 people in mainland China. Millions of people are currently quarantined in and around Wuhan in an effort to contain the virus. So far, more than 71,000 people have been sickened worldwide. In mid-February, Egypt announced it had the first-reported case in Africa.",FALSE

A data map that appeared in a popular Twitter thread did not show what some people claimed.
On Feb. 8, 2019, a well-shared Twitter thread claimed that “data” showed a massive increase in sulfur emissions over Wuhan, China. The thread further suggested that a likely explanation for this alleged observation was the cremation of bodies associated with the outbreak of the new coronavirus whose origin is in that region:

The Sun and The Express, among other outlets, uncritically repeated this claim, despite its dubious origins. Both outlets later deleted their stories without a correction note by the time of our reporting. The Sun, for example, had described the above image as showing the “extent of corpse burning in Wuhan.” That premise is fatally flawed for at least two reasons.
First and most significantly: The data presented are not a real-time observation of sulfur concentrations above Wuhan. Instead, the image is a computer-model output designed to predict, based on a historical knowledge of the area and its current atmospheric conditions, what concentration of sulfur is likely present in the air at a given time and place. Second, sulfur is not a significant emission from human cremation. It is, however, a significant emission from the burning of coal in power plants or for other industrial uses like iron and steel production. The area directly below the hotspot shown in Twitter thread is, in fact, the Wuhan Iron & Steel Company.
Problem One: Not an Actual Observation of Sulfur Dioxide Concentrations
The source of the data highlighted in the Twitter thread is a company named Windy.com, which combines several models and meteorological inputs to create global maps of weather conditions aimed primarily at people who partake in outdoor sports. Windy, in turn, gets its sulfur data from a NASA climate model named GEOS-5. Arlindo da Silva, a research meteorologist at NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, told the British fact-checking organization Full Fact that the GEOS-5 sulphur dioxide models do not “assimilate real satellite data” into their forecasts.
Instead, he said, “Our forecasts are based on fixed emission inventories,” which “do not account for the day-to-day variations in SO2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity.” The sulfur fluctuations present in the GEOS-5 model stem from “variations in the meteorological conditions, in particular winds.” The high levels of industry in the region — the Wuhan Iron & Steel Company — are likely the cause of higher “emission inventories” prescribed by the model for the Wuhan region.
Problem Two: Sulfur Emissions Are Not A Significant Factor in Cremation
The viral twitter thread asserts that “sulfur dioxide [is] commonly associated with the burning of organic matters.” This is a technically correct statement that is grossly misleading in this context. Sulfur dioxide is commonly associated with the burning of coal. Coal, formed from the carbon compounds of dead plant material buried and heated naturally in the earth for millions to hundreds of millions of years, is indeed an example of “organic matter” that, when burned, can release sulfur dioxide.
Humans, while also an example of organic matter, nevertheless contain a negligible amount of sulfur. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus make up more than 99% of all chemicals in the human body, leaving less than 1 percent for anything else, including sulfur. The sulfur present in coal dominantly comes from geologic processes that occur over millions of years. As such, a recently deceased body, when burned, is not going to generate an abundance of sulfur compounds even if there were live satellite measurements to document that release of chemicals (which there are not).
Cremation and the Coronavirus
None of this is to say that there has not been an increase in cremation in areas in China affected by the spread of the coronavirus. On Feb. 2, 2020, the Chinese government announced that it was banning all funerals for victims of the viral infection, further stipulating that cremation would be required for their bodies.
However, the suggestion that satellite data provides a measurable signal of increases in cremation relies on two fundamental misunderstandings about both the atmospheric model at issue and the chemistry used to interpret it. As such, we rate this claim as “False.”",FALSE
5758.0,Onions placed in bowls around your home will fight off the flu virus.,"Do Onions Fight Off the Flu Virus?
Placing cut onions in bowls around your home might make your domicile slightly more aromatic, but it won't fight off the flu virus.
Although influenza is no longer the unchecked grim reaper of years past (in 1918 it killed half a million Americans and twenty to forty million folks worldwide), it continues to present a very real danger even in these more modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), millions of people in the United States (about 10% to 20% of U.S. residents) will get the flu each year. Influenza also costs Americans $10 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses. Worst of all, every year about 36,000 people in the United States die from it, and 114,000 have to be admitted to the hospital because of it. The flu is not just a week of feeling lousy and missing work; it is a disease that can and does kill.
The 2009 outbreak of H1N1 (swine) flu brought home even to those who didn’t normally ponder such matters the danger posed by contagions dismissively regarded in other years as mere seasonal flu, maladies that are thought of as wholly unpleasant but not life threatening. In 2009, people became more aware of the sniffles and sneezes around them. Also, unlike in other years, more folks were actively looking for ways to avoid catching the flu — including by unconventional means, such as those referenced in the following message:
Onions, for collecting the flu virus:
In 1919 when the flu killed 40 million people there was this Doctor that visited the many farmers to see if he could help them combat the flu. Many of the farmers and their family had contracted it and many died.
The doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise, everyone was very healthy. When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home, (probably only two rooms back then). The doctor couldn’t believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and placed it under the microscope. She gave him one and when he did this, he did find the flu virus in the onion. It obviously absorbed the virus,
therefore, keeping the family healthy.
Now, I heard this story from my hairdresser in AZ. She said that several years ago many of her employees were coming down with the flu and so were many of her customers. The next year she placed several bowls with onions around in her shop. To her surprise, none of her staff got sick. It must work.. (And no, she is not in the onion business.)
The moral of the story is, buy some onions and place them in bowls around your home. If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere. Try it and see what happens. We did it last year and we never got the flu.
If this helps you and your loved ones from getting sick, all the better. If you do get the flu, it just might be a mild case..
Whatever, what have you to lose? Just a few bucks on onions!
In addition to the good advice about washing one’s hands frequently and avoiding the company of those who are obviously under the weather, those looking to sidestep being felled by the flu are subject to toutings of a variety of folk remedies, each of which is presented as a surefire and deadly preventive. The missive quoted above about onions absorbing the virus is one such offering.
There’s no medical magic to placing peeled or cut onions around the home: they don’t act as sponges that soak up whatever viruses or other nasty microbes are in their immediate vicinity. However, the belief that they would act in this fashion predates the 2009 flu outbreak by at least 100 years. Long-standing superstition asserts that keeping raw onions in the house (either cut or whole; different folks swear by different methods) will draw illness-causing germs from the air, thereby rendering the home free of contamination. The following print references gathered by folklorists Iona Opie and Moira Tatum showcase that belief:
The onion is cut up and stood in an old tin-plate. Then you place it in the room where the sick child sleeps. The onion draws the complaint into itself, and when the child is better care must be taken to see that the onion is properly burnt.

When there’s flu about, I puts a plate of cut up onion in every room. That’s what keeps colds away … All the cold germs goes into they.

I fondly remember the smell of my mother’s window sill adorned with half onions. She swore by the legend that the onions captured any incoming germs and purified the air.
Even older print sightings exist, however. One of the earliest we’ve located (from 1900) calls the practice “an old custom,” which means even at that early date, the belief’s origins were lost in the mists of time:
[Chambers’ Journal, 1900]
In remote country villages one sometimes sees an old custom which, in its essence, is wise, though the performers do not know its why or wherefore; as their forbears did, so do they. This is to place plates full of sliced onion at the side of any bed or coffin wherein lies the body of a person dead of infections [sic] disease. This good and shrewd practice was based on the observation of the blackening of the onion and practical experience of the usefulness of the habit, not on scientific knowledge. But the floating germs were attracted to that blackening onion, and settled on thickly, the result being the onion’s discoloration and the great purification of the air in the death-chamber. The story is true of a house wherein ropes of onions intended for sale were hung escaping a smallpox epidemic, which attacked the neighbouring houses.

[Los Angeles Times, 1913]
In a sickroom you cannot have a better disinfectant than the onion. It has a wonderful capacity for absorbing germs. A dish of sliced onions placed in a sickroom will draw away the disease; they must be removed as soon as they lose their odor and become discolored, and be replaced by fresh ones.

[The Chicago Defender, 1922]
In remote villages the old custom still exists of placing a plate full of sliced onion beside the bed or coffin of any persons who had died of an infectious disease. Although those who follow this practice cannot explain it, the fact is that the raw onion destroys germs and purifies the infected air of the death chamber.
Some people insist plates of sliced raw onion should be left at various points around the home; others avow that whole onions must be hung on strings affixed to the domicile’s ceilings, some further asserting the bulbs must be hung in front of doorways to better filter incoming contamination. As to what sorts of contamination the onion is purported to overcome, at various times it has been said to kill flu virus, diphtheria, smallpox, the cold virus, and even whatever nastiness a rotting corpse might be venting into the air, especially one that reached that condition via infectious disease of any description. Onions are also, according to lore, to be placed in any sickroom no matter how that room’s occupant came to require bedrest.
While this folk belief is indeed an old one, there’s precious little reason to place any store in it. No scientific studies back it, and common sense rules it out: cold and flu viruses are spread by contact, not by their nasty microbes floating loosely in the air where the almighty onion can supposedly seek out and destroy them. As the Wall Street Journal noted in 2009 of such claims:
Biologists say it’s highly implausible that onions could attract flu virus as a bug zapper traps flies. Viruses require a living host to replicate and can’t propel themselves out of a body and across a room.
The idea that onions have medicinal properties goes back millennia and spans many cultures. Egyptians thought onions were fertility symbols. Ancient Greeks rubbed them on sore muscles, and Native Americans used them to treat coughs and colds. Herbalists note that the World Health Organization recognizes onion extracts for providing relief in the treatment of coughs, colds, asthma and bronchitis. As with most home remedies, there have been few scientific studies with humans — and none on record involving raw onions placed across a room.
Furthermore, for those who believe in folk claims, superstition also asserts that it is unlucky to keep cut onions around, as demonstrated in these additional examples gathered by Opie and Tatum:
[1855]
To have a cut onion lying about in the house breeds distempers.

[1891]
An old servant (Essex) … recently complained that … Spanish onions … were too big. When an obvious method of getting over that difficulty was suggested, she replied, ‘Oh, no! that would never do! It’s so unlucky to have a cut onion in the house.’

[1958]
Special small onions are being grown for me as I am liable to keep half a cut onion from one meal to another, which I am assured is highly dangerous.
Onions — cut, peeled, or otherwise — aren’t going to secure your living space from the flu virus, either 2009’s swine version or any other year’s contagion. Instead, if you want to stay healthy, wash your hands and avoid being around sick people.
Mind you, if you choose to place a few onions around your home, the only downside would be that your nearest and dearest will regard you as somewhat eccentric.",FALSE

Speculation does not equal evidence.
WARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers. 
In February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus. 
Actor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:

Although the video attached to Woods’ tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.

While the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.
Clip 1
Are these armed doctors?
Rating: Miscaptioned.
The first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals. 
While we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word “police” can be briefly seen on the hood of this car. 

Clip 2
Are these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?
Rating: Miscaptioned.
The second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:
New video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. There’re multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.
There was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims. 
Nobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed “gunfire.” This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.

This is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident. 
Remnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike. 
Les Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a “one-vehicle road accident”: 
“In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.”
In Summary
Although Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.
When we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator’s assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be “atypical” for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.

Watching this video may give some viewers the impression that coronavirus was far more widespread than each of the aforementioned diseases. However, this tweet contains just a short clip from a video that was created by YouTube user Abacaba.
In the full video, just after the clip above ends, the graph changes dramatically as cases of swine flu skyrocket. By day 260, the coronavirus, SARS, MERS, and Ebola are dwarfed by the swine flu epidemic:

The video goes on to show how another epidemic, the Spanish flu of 1918, spread faster and to far more people than the coronavirus:

The viral clip above accurately shows how tens of thousands of cases of coronavirus were reported over a short time span. However, it seems to have given viewers the incorrect impression that the outbreak was unprecedented. 
Here’s the original video. The portion containing the above-displayed graph starts around 1:20:



We have not fact-checked every second of this 10-minute video. We can say, however, that it appears that the numbers reported in this viral graph are accurate. YouTube user Abacaba posted sources for all of the data shown in this graph and  we have verified the final numbers shown in this viral portion of the video. 
Reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that there were approximately 8,000 cases of SARS, 28,000 cases of Ebola, 60 million cases of swine flu, and approximately 500 million cases resulting in 50 million deaths from the Spanish flu. The number of coronavirus cases reported in this video (approximately 40,000) was taken from an interactive guide created by the University of Washington. While that was likely accurate when this video was released on Feb. 12, as of this writing, the number of reported coronavirus cases has grown to more than 80,000.
While the coronavirus is rightly causing concern around the globe, WHO has attempted to quell some of those fears. On a web page dedicated to information about the outbreak, WHO wrote on Feb. 23 that if you don’t live in, or have traveled recently to, an area where coronavirus is spreading, your chances of getting the disease are currently low:
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low. However, it’s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It’s a good idea to get the facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See Protection measures for everyone).

As the coronavirus spread in 2020, a fierce outbreak of bad advice took hold online.
As the coronavirus known as COVID-19 spread around the globe in March 2020, a piece of advice repeated frequently was to wash your hands often. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using soap and water, but the internet had another suggestion: Tito’s Vodka. 
A popular rumor on social media held that people could fight off the coronavirus by combining hand gel and Tito’s Vodka in a homemade hand sanitizer:

This is not true. Tito’s Vodka cannot be used to make effective hand sanitizer. 
A number of DIY articles on the internet explain how to make homemade hand sanitizer. While some of these articles specified that vodka containing at least 60% alcohol was required to make an effective hand sanitizer, others simply stated that any vodka would do. Good Housekeeping, for instance, published an article on March 2 that told readers they could make homemade hand sanitizer with any “plain vodka.” 
But that isn’t the case. The CDC writes that people can use an “alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol” if soap and water is not available. But most vodkas (including Tito’s) only contain 40%.
Tito’s has been responding to people on social media informing them that the product is not a suitable hand sanitizer.

I cannot verify this story but this is an alert. Just got this from a friend that works with the Customs and Excise in Nigeria. There is a bottle water killing people, The name is DEW. Please do not buy/drink. It is contaminated with dangerous chemicals that destroy one’s body system. 180 died in Tanzania. It is in the Nigerian market, pass it on.

The message was a hoax of uncertain origin. No one had died or become seriously ill from drinking Dew® water.  Nigeria’s Food and Drugs Board (FDB) established the rumor as false after conducting investigations, and a separate investigation by the Nigerian National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) in several hospitals around Nigeria revealed no incidents of hospitalization or death arising from consumption of Dew® or any other brand of bottled water.
In an official statement about the rumor, NAFDAC said:

The attention of NAFDAC has been drawn to a widely circulating text message which is alarming the public, alleging the importation of killer ‘Dew’ water into the country. According to the text message, the said Dew Water purportedly killed 180 people in one of the East African Countries where it was imported and also led to the hospitalization of many Nigerians.”

On the plus side, this ""treatment"" might help keep away others who could potentially infect you.
In early 2020 the global spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, saw the internet flooded with dubious medical advice about how to avoid or cure the illness. One such example — supposedly originating with the medical sage known as “old Chinese doctor” — held that consuming a bowl of boiled garlic water would “improve and cure” persons afflicted with the malady overnight:

Garlic has long been claimed as possessing qualities that aid in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, including colds and flu, but scientific evidence supporting such claims is weak or lacking.
The World Health Organization (WHO) specifically addressed this rumor in reference to COVID-19 and noted that although “garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties,” there’s no evidence that “eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus”:

BBC News similarly reported of this rumor that:
In lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren’t harmful in themselves, as long as they aren’t preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.
The South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic.

Inaccurate messages about the new coronavirus are spreading and mutating online. One frequently copied and pasted bit of text that has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp purports to impart “serious excellent advice” from “Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.”
That “advice” asserts regular sips of water can prevent the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, from entering the respiratory system:
SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.  Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth … drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy … your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly … the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That’s very dangerous.
The “serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors” text is often combined with other viral coronavirus claims including a paragraph about a “self-check” attributed to “Taiwan experts,” and a set of recommendations that begins with a claim about differentiating between a cold and COVID-19. Snopes addressed the “Taiwan experts self-check” claim here and addressed the list of tips that begins with a dubious method of distinguishing a cold from COVID-19 here. This article deals only with the claim regarding sipping water every 15 minutes.
Water Will Not Prevent the Coronavirus from Entering Your Lungs
It is true that COVID-19 infects the respiratory system by directly entering the body through the mouth or nose. This fact is central to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to wash hands frequently and avoid touching your face. The assertion in this viral “advice,” however, is that if the virus were already in your mouth, water would help wash it away. Though medical officials recommend drinking water during any infection, no evidence exists to support the notion that sipping water prevents a virus from infecting the respiratory system.
Drinking more water, while good for your overall health, will not keep anyone from catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner told The Associated Press, “We always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist.” He also said: “It makes you feel better; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications.”
Dr. Susan Wootton, an infectious disease expert at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, agreed with that assessment, telling KHOU that no data exist to support the claim that sipping water will prevent infection by transporting it to the stomach.
Because no evidence supports the claim, we rank the notion that sipping water regularly prevents COVID-19 infection as “False.”",FALSE

As the new coronavirus, which is responsible for the disease COVID-19, spreads worldwide, so too has viral advice for combating the pandemic.
One frequently copied and pasted bit of text that has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp suggests a simple self-check for coronavirus infection, usually attributed to “Taiwan Experts,” “Stanford University,” or “Stanford Hospital Board,” among others:
The new Coronavirus may not show signs of infection for many days. How can you know if you are infected? By the time you have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% fibrosis. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold it for more than 10 seconds. If you do this successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, there is no fibrosis in the lungs; it basically indicates no infection. In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.
Stanford Health Care, for their part, explicitly stated they had nothing to do with the email:
A widely distributed email about COVID-19 that is attributed to a “Stanford Hospital board member” contains inaccurate information. It did not come from Stanford Medicine.
The viral text is often combined with other frequently recurring coronavirus claims including a paragraph attributed to “serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors” about keeping your throat moist, and a set of recommendations that begins with a claim about differentiating between a cold and COVID-19. Snopes addressed the “serious excellent advice” here, and addressed the list of tips that begin with a purported way to diagnose a cold versus COVID-19 here. This article deals only with the “self-check” claim attributed to Taiwan experts, which is flawed for several reasons.
The “simple self-check” hinges on two central and unsupported assertions: First, that early COVID-19 infections include as a symptom a condition known as pulmonary fibrosis; and second, that the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds is an accurate indicator of fibrosis. Neither is the case.
Pulmonary Fibrosis Is Not a Symptom of COVID-19
Fibrosis occurs when excess connective tissue is deposited in the lungs in response to scarring or other factors. This excess of tissue can severely reduce the ability of lungs to bring oxygen to the body. To date, no major health agency has listed fibrosis as a symptom of COVID-19 at any stage in its progression. It is not listed as a symptom in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) “Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease,” nor is it listed as a symptom in the World Health Organization’s joint report with China on the progression and spread of the disease.
While serious cases of COVID-19 usually involve pneumonia, which can cause scarring damage to the lungs, such damage would necessarily come after one showed obvious symptoms of pneumonia. The “self-check,” even if it had any diagnostic power at all, illogically implies damage to the lungs would precede other symptoms including coughing, even though it is the coughing that would be responsible for any respiratory damage in the first place.
Holding Your Breath Is Not a Valid Test for Pulmonary Fibrosis
The viral claim asserts that if you can hold your breath for more than 10 seconds “without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, there is no fibrosis in the lungs” and that this “basically indicates no infection.”
While holding your breath is likely harder if your lung capacity is reduced, there is no scientific support for the notion that holding your breath for 10 seconds indicates a clean bill of health, nor is there support for the implied assertion that the only reason holding your breath for 10 seconds would be hard is because COVID-19 caused pulmonary fibrosis.  Several factors can reduce lung function, including allergies, asthma, chronic conditions, and infections. As such, there are multiple forms of respiratory tests that doctors perform on lungs to identify problems. None of them involves one’s ability to hold their breath for 10 seconds.
Because holding your breath is not a valid test for fibrosis, and because fibrosis is not a symptom of COVID-19, we rank this advice from “Taiwan experts” as “False.”",FALSE

As of early March 2020, Italy had seen the worst COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia.
As the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic in early March 2020, alarmed readers asked Snopes to verify reports that nearly 200 people died in a 24-hour span in Italy as a result of the disease.
Sadly it is true that between March 10 and March 11, 2020, 196 people died in Italy, which was suffering the worst outbreak of COVID-19 outside Asia.
Reuters reported on March 11 that, “The death toll from coronaviruses in Italy has risen from 196 to 827, an increase of 31%, Civil Protection [Agency] announced today.”
The situation worsened the next day as an additional spate of deaths was reported. On March 12, The New York Times reported, “The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has jumped in the last 24 hours by 189 to 1,016, a rise of 23%, the Civil Protection Agency said.”
Italy was struggling to keep pace with the disease, running low on hospital beds and equipment to treat the rapidly-spreading virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019.
The news of these fatalities came amid announcements in the United States that everything from basketball tournaments to Disneyland were shutting down in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.

Medical professionals believe positive coronavirus retests are more likely the result of errors in testing rather than reinfection.
As the world grappled with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in early 2020, people around the globe began to consider the dread possibility that COVID-19 might not only be more infectious and have a much higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu, but that at least some persons who survived  it might become reinfected rather than developing an immunity to it.  
A few reports have trickled in from around the world suggesting that someone who had COVID-19 recovered and then fell ill with it again, such as the following account from China:

Mr. Wang, a resident of Xuzhou, in Jiangsu province, appeared to have emerged victorious from a monthlong battle with the illness. 
Three days later, though, Wang tested positive for the coronavirus again. He was re-hospitalized and his neighbors were locked down once more. His current condition is unknown.
Wang, whose full name has not been disclosed for privacy reasons, is one of more than 100 reported cases of Chinese patients who have been released from hospitals as survivors of the new coronavirus — only to test positive for it a second time in the bewildering math of this mysterious illness.

However, at this juncture it’s difficult to determine whether such reports document that fully recovered COVID-19 patients truly became infected anew, or whether those persons may have relapsed or not completely recovered from their first bout of the illness.  Problems with diagnostic testing techniques have been raised as one possibility to explain why some patients might have retested positive for COVID-19 after seemingly recovering:

[Such cases] are raising questions in China about the reliability of diagnostic tests, the possibility of reinfection and whether patients are wrongly designated as “recovered” and released too early from hospitals.
Scientists in and outside China agree that reinfection is a highly unlikely explanation for the patients who retest positive. They say testing errors are more likely to blame — either false negatives that resulted in patients being discharged too early, or false positives when they retested and were taken back into hospital.
Those errors could be attributed to contaminated test samples, human error while taking swabs, or an oversensitive nucleic acid test that detects strands of virus.

The Los Angeles Times quoted Dr. Keiji Fukuda, director of Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health, as saying that COVID-19 reinfection was unlikely and that false positives in testing procedures were a more likely possibility:

“If you get an infection, your immune system is revved up against that virus,” he said. “To get reinfected again when you’re in that situation would be quite unusual unless your immune system was not functioning right.”
What’s more likely is that people are being released from hospitals while still carrying dormant fragments of the disease that are not infectious but resemble the virus when put through a nucleic acid test, he said.
“The test may be positive, but the infection is not there,” he said

Dr. Clifford Lane, deputy director for Clinical Research and Special Projects at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also quoted as suggesting that the real issue was with inaccuracies in testing patients who had not fully recovered rather than with reinfection:

Another possibility is that the level of virus fell below the threshold that tests could detect but then resurfaced, [Lane] said.
“So it looks like [some patients] cleared the virus and then the virus came back,” Lane said. “But they never really cleared it and they had a more prolonged course of infection.”
Lane was one of only two U.S. experts in a World Health Organization delegation that visited China in February. He said Chinese experts told the visitors that there were no examples of people who became “reinfected.”

A coronavirus infection’s going into a “dormant” stage and then re-emerging was another possibility for explaining the appearance of reinfection suggested by Dr. Philip M. Tierno, Clinical Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at at New York University: “Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant with minimal symptoms.  And then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs.” 
The Associated Press also offered the possibility that mutations in the virus might conceivably make it different enough to reinfect persons who had acquired immunity to an earlier version:

Scientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It’s not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who is for many Americans the most familiar source for information on the coronavirus disease (due to his numerous appearances at government press conferences and cable television news reports), told Congress that he felt it was unlikely anyone could become reinfected by the virus: “We haven’t formally proved it, but … if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won’t get reinfected.”   
While this topic is an area that requires additional study, medical professionals still caution that “The things to worry about are at the other end of the illness” — that the primary focus should still be on limiting the outbreak by trying to ensure that symptomatic and undiagnosed persons are not exposing themselves to, and potentially infecting, others.",FALSE

French medical advice warned that ""adverse effects"" of drugs such as ibuprofen had been reported in coronavirus patients.
Adding to the extant confusion swirling about the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in March 2020, the French government, including Health Minister Olivier Véran, issued warnings advising that infected persons should avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen:

Serious adverse events related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients with COVID19, possible or confirmed cases. We remind you that the treatment of a poorly tolerated fever or pain in the context of COVID19 or any other respiratory virosis is based on paracetamol, without exceeding the dose of 60 mg/kg/day and 3g/day. NSAIDs should be banned.

COVID-19 — Taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, …) could be a factor in worsening the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol [also known as acetaminophen]. If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs or in doubt, ask your doctor for advice.
Dr. Amir Khan, a National Health Service (NHS) doctor and a senior university lecturer in the U.K., offered the following explanation about why taking anti-inflammatory drugs might have a deleterious effect on persons dealing with a COVID-19 infection:
Despite all of their beneficial effects, it has long been known that anti-inflammatories can have a depressive effect on parts of our immune systems.
When it comes to taking them to help ease the symptoms of the common cold, we do not really have to worry about this slight but important reduction in the strength of our immune systems: We are very unlikely to develop complications from the common cold, let alone die from it.
But we need our immune system in top working order in order to battle the coronavirus and win.
When the virus enters the human body, it induces mild to severe respiratory problems, a high fever, cough and, potentially, multi-organ dysfunction, which can lead to death.
An early part of our body’s immune response to a virus of this sort is to release cells called mast cells, which form our first line of defense against the virus.
These [mast cells] are released very quickly from our respiratory tract — the nasal passageway and linings of the lungs.
When the mast cells come into contact with the virus, they then trigger a much bigger immune response, which involves inflammatory chemicals being released.
We need these inflammatory chemicals to help tackle the virus in the medium to long term. It is the effectiveness of these chemicals that decides whether a person develops complications from the coronavirus or makes a full recovery.
If we take medicines that dampen this immune response, such as ibuprofen, this can lead to us not fighting off the infection as effectively, potentially leading to a longer illness with a higher risk of complications.
These warnings to avoid ibuprofen (commonly known by the brand name Advil) generated mixed reactions among the medical community, with some asserting that scientific evidence to support it was lacking, and others maintaining that it was generally good advice:
“Deeply concerned about this bold statement,” Muge Cevik, a researcher at the University of St Andrews Infection and Global Health Division, said on Twitter. “There’s no scientific evidence I am aware of that ibuprofen [causes worse] outcomes in #COVID19.”
But other experts suggested that Véran’s advice is in line with some countries’ general guidance on anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen, even if their specific connection to the coronavirus is not clear.
“There is a good reason to avoid ibuprofen as it may exacerbate acute kidney injury brought on by any severe illness, including severe COVID-19 disease. There isn’t yet any widely accepted additional reason to avoid it for COVID-19,” Rupert Beale, a group leader in Cell Biology of Infection at the UK’s Francis Crick Institute, told the UK’s Science Media Centre.
Exemplifying that split of opinion, Dr. Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant physician at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, observed that it was unclear whether the proffered advice about ibuprofen was specific to COVID-19 or merely ordinary “good practice,” but that in any case paracetamol “would generally be preferred over ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever”:
In the UK, paracetamol would generally be preferred over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDS”) such as ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever. This is because, when taken according to the manufacturer’s and/or a health professional’s instructions in terms of timing and maximum dosage, it is less likely to cause side effects. Side effects associated with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, especially if taken regularly for a prolonged period, are stomach irritation and stress on the kidneys, which can be more severe in people who already have stomach or kidney issues. It is not clear from the French Minister’s comments whether the advice given is generic ‘good practice’ guidance or specifically related to data emerging from cases of Covid-19 but this might become clear in due course. It should also be noted that, in the UK, we would not commonly use cortisone to relieve infection-related symptoms such as fever.
As Khan cautioned, for now patients and their doctors will need to be aware of the “careful balance between managing the symptoms of their long-term health condition and risking the devastating effects of the coronavirus.” He advised that paracetamol or acetaminophen may be preferable alternative medications for pain and fever associated with COVID-19.",FALSE
6027.0,Gargling with salt water or Vinegar 'eliminate' the COVID-19 coronavirus from the throat of an infected person's system.,"Will Gargling with Salt Water or Vinegar ‘Eliminate’ the COVID-19 Coronavirus?
What works for colds is unlikely to help an already-infected person stave off the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.
The COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of early 2020 brought a raft of dubious and false medical advice about the prevention and treatment of the illness to the internet, among which was one widely circulated graphic advocating that persons exposed to the virus try gargling various substance to ‘eliminate’ the virus and prevent it from reaching the lungs via the throat: 
“Corona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus. Spread this information because you can save someone with this information.”

While gargling some combination of warm water, salt, and vinegar has long been used as a means of relieving symptoms related to colds and flus, such as sore throats, there’s no evidence that it can help ward off or drive out infections from the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.  And although the virus is said to replicate in the nose and nasal secretions, we’ve found nothing documenting the notion that the current coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and can be effectively expelled at the conclusion of that time period to keep it from reaching the lungs.  (The incubation period for this virus, which is the time between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms, has been estimated at about five days on average.)
The World Health Organization’s (WHO) website offers a page offering COVID-19 coronavirus disease advice for the public which addresses the substance of this rumor in an item about rinsing nasal passages (which are connected to the throat) with saline:

There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. 
There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.






Drinking sufficient water to stay adequately hydrated is generally good health advice at any time, but gargling with it (whether in plain form or as saline/vinegar) is of doubtful benefit for ‘eliminating’ the coronavirus once it has already taken",FALSE

In early March 2020, as the availability and cost of testing members of the public for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease sweeping the globe was a hot issue, a widely-shared tweet offered a supposed “loophole” for obtaining such testing for free. Just volunteer to donate blood, it asserted, and the agency taking your donation would have to test you for free:

However, it’s not the case that all blood banks are performing coronavirus tests on donors — as news reports have noted, “blood donation centers do not have test kits on hand to check for the coronavirus.” 
Moreover, as the American Red Cross declared in a statement, conducting such tests on donors is unnecessary because “there is no data or evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases of transmissions for any respiratory virus, including this coronavirus, worldwide.”
The Associated Press likewise reported of the subject that:

Blood banks said they do not test for the novel coronavirus as part of the donation process. […]
“We do a whole range of testing on blood donations as required by the FDA, but screening or testing for coronavirus is not happening,” said Kate Fry, chief executive officer of America’s Blood Centers, a North American network of nonprofit blood centers. The network oversees more than 600 blood collection sites.
Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of the American Red Cross, told the AP that screeners do not test for the coronavirus as part of the process.
“The last thing we would want is for people who are not healthy coming just to try to get tested,” she said.

However, organizations such as the American Red Cross do advise that people should not donate blood now if they know or suspect they have been exposed to the coronavirus:

[T]he American Red Cross has implemented new blood donation deferrals out of an abundance of caution. We are now asking that individuals postpone their donation for 28 days following:
o Travel to China and its special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Iran, Italy and South Korea.
o Diagnosis of COVID-19, contact with a person who has the virus, or is suspected to have it.

As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Tell us about any questionable, confusing, or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter. 

In March 2020, as the COVID-19 coronavirus disease continued to spread around the globe, worried citizens started to stock up on supplies to “wait out the storm” in the relative safety of their homes. As store shelves were temporarily emptied, a viral message started to circulate on social media that claimed anyone looking for baby formula during this pandemic could obtain some by simply calling the number on the back of one of these products: 

This viral meme reads: “For parents who cannot find formula in stores for their babies right now grab the can of formula that you do have, and call the number on the back and they will send you a whole case during this time!”
This is not true. You can’t receive a free case of baby formula simply by calling the number on the back of a product. This claim appears to have originated out of whole cloth. 
One red flag that indicates this post contains faulty advice is that no specific company is identified in the message. We searched the websites of some of the larger baby formula brands, such as Gerber and Enfamil, and found no announcements about how parents could obtain baby formula via this method during the pandemic. 
The Motherload, a Facebook group for mothers, reached out to Aptamil Customer Services and quoted the company as saying the rumor was false. From the Facebook post:
“I’m afraid this is not true and I’m really sorry to hear that people are spreading false rumours at such a worrying time. The World Health Organisation guidelines on the promotion of breastmilk substitutes STRICTLY prohibit us from giving out free milk under ANY circumstances.”
And a spokesperson for that company also confirmed to Yahoo News that the rumor was false:
“This is not true and I’m really sorry to hear that people are spreading false rumours at such a worrying time.
“The World Health Organization guidelines on the promotion of breastmilk substitutes strictly prohibit us from giving out free milk under any circumstances.”
We reached out to Gerber for more comment and will update this article if more information becomes available. 
In sum, this claim does not appear to have originated with a manufacturer of baby formula and seems to have been made up from whole cloth. As such we rate it as “False.”",FALSE

In mid-March 2020, many social media users reported receiving a text message informing them that a “mandatory quarantine” or a “national lockdown” would occur in the next 48 hours in the U.S. to control the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. While a few versions of this viral message exist, the following text appears to be one of the most popular iterations:
Please be advised, within 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke what is called the Stafford act. Just got off the phone with some of my military friends down in DC who had a two hour briefing. The president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network.
This is not an official message from the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), city officials, or any other official governing body. This is a chain message that makes unfounded claims. As of this writing, no official announcements have been made regarding a national lockdown or a mandatory quarantine in the U.S.
The National Security Council addressed these messages on Twitter, writing that messages about a “national quarantine” were fake:

Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus
— NSC (@WHNSC) March 16, 2020

These text messages started circulating in mid-March 2020. At the time, sporting events were being canceled across the country, cities were closing schools, restaurants, and bars, and health officials were encouraging everyone to practice “social distancing.” These texts also went viral on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that he was declaring a national emergency.   
Like many false social media rumors, a hint of truth underlay these viral text messages. When Trump declared the national emergency on March 13, he did so under the Stafford Act, a 1988 law that empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to respond to national catastrophes. 
Reuters reported:
The law, enacted in 1988, empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist state and local governments during “natural catastrophes” and coordinate the nation’s response.
FEMA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, controls more than $40 billion in federal funding set aside by Congress for disaster relief. FEMA could use that funding to help build medical facilities and transport patients, among other measures.
Only the president can declare a major disaster under the law.
USA Today reported that in addition to providing more funding to fight the spread of COVID-19, Trump’s emergency declaration would authorize Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, to waive certain restrictions in order to give people better access to healthcare. Trump’s declaration, however, did not authorize Azar to declare a “national quarantine.”
While the White House did not announce a national lockdown, the CDC recommended on March 15, 2020, that the U.S. should prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also encouraged Americans to prepare to “hunker down” and limit their social interactions. 
While the text messages spreading this claim did not originate with any official sources, the scenario they propose is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. San Francisco, California, for instance, announced a “shelter in place” order on March 16, 2020:

BAY AREA MUST 'SHELTER IN PLACE'

A viral social media post claimed Italian doctors were not treating older patients with coronavirus due to ""socialized medicine.""
As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Tell us about any questionable, confusing, or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter. 

As the COVID-19 new coronavirus disease spread across the United States in early 2020, so did anxiety, as people looked to how the virus had affected Italy, already deep in the throes of the pandemic. A social media meme exacerbated the anxiety with the claim that Italian doctors had “decided NOT to treat the elderly,” and that that was the result of “socialized medicine.”
As of mid-March, Italy was the hardest-hit nation outside of Asia and had become the new epicenter for the global pandemic. As in China, where the virus was initially detected in the winter of 2019, the Italian health care system was overwhelmed by the disease. Amid fears that the United States could end up in a similar situation, a viral Facebook meme pointed the finger at Italy’s government-run health care system.The meme appears to represent both an exaggeration and distortion of news reports and events in Italy regarding the coronavirus. Readers also inquired about an article published by the British news publication The Telegraph, headlined, “Italians over 80 ‘will be left to die’ as country overwhelmed by coronavirus.” The article references a document drawn up by health officials in Turin, a city in Northern Italy hit hard by the virus, with guidelines for if and when “It becomes impossible to provide all patients with intensive care service.” In such a case, the document says, “It will be necessary to apply criteria for access to intensive treatment, which depends on the limited resources available.”
The Telegraph reported that the document “produced by the civil protection department of the Piedmont region, one of those hardest hit, says: ‘The criteria for access to intensive therapy in cases of emergency must include age of less than 80 or a score on the Charlson comorbidity Index [which indicates how many other medical conditions the patient has] of less than 5.'”
The guidelines were expected to affect the whole country and go into effect, according to the Telegraph, “‘If the situation becomes of such an exceptional nature as to make the therapeutic choices on the individual case dependent on the availability of resources, forcing [hospitals] to focus on those cases in which the cost/benefit ratio is more favorable for clinical treatment.'”
In other words, it is not true that Italy as a whole had “decided not to treat their elderly” for the coronavirus. What is true per news reports is that overwhelmed Italian health systems that have more patients than available equipment could face “catastrophe” triage decisions not seen since World War II. That has nothing to do the fact that Italy, like other European countries, has a public health care system, or what some people call “socialized medicine.” It is instead the result of the sheer volume of cases flooding the hospitals.
As of March 12, 2020, The New York Times reported that Italian officials had maintained that everyone who needed care was entitled to it. In a public statement on the matter, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stated, “We live in a system in which we guarantee health and the right of everyone to be cured. It’s a foundation, a pillar, and I’d say a characteristic of our system of civilization. And thus we can’t allow ourselves to let our guard down.”
The Times also reported that Flavia Petrini, president of the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care, had issued “catastrophe medicine” guidelines:
“In a context of grave shortage of health resources,” the guidelines say, intensive care should be given to “patients with the best chance of success” and those with the “best hope of life” should be prioritized.
The guidelines also say that in “in the interests of maximizing benefits for the largest number,” limits could be put on intensive care units to reserve scarce resources to those who have, first, “greater likelihood of survival and secondly who have more potential years of life.”
“No one is getting kicked out, but we’re offering criteria of priority,” Dr. Petrini said. “These choices are made in normal times, but what’s not normal is when you have to assist 600 people all at once.”
Giulio Gallera, the Lombardy official leading the emergency response, said on Thursday that he hoped the guidelines never needed to be applied.
In sum, Italy did not announce it would abandon elderly patients with COVID-19 wholesale. Instead, health care workers in various circumstances and locales might be forced to ration treatment and make judgments based on who is expected to live longest, if treated. Chinese doctors have faced this situation, and some fear it may be in store for the U.S. health care system if the number of active coronavirus cases in the United States isn’t successfully controlled. We therefore rate this claim a “Mixture” of true and false.",mixture

Things appeared pretty bleak in March 2020 as the COVID-19 coronavirus disease continued to spread across the globe. Businesses and restaurants were being shut down, people were asked to stay inside their homes, and the stock market was crashing. But, according to viral list on social media, it wasn’t all bad news. 
On March 16, a Facebook post that supposedly highlighted some “good news” about COVID-19 started to spread online:
How about some good news?
– China has closed down its last coronavirus hospital. Not enough new cases to support them.
– Doctors in India have been successful in treating Coronavirus. Combination of drugs used: Lopinavir, Retonovir, Oseltamivir along with Chlorphenamine. They are going to suggest same medicine, globally.
– Researchers of the Erasmus Medical Center claim to have found an antibody against coronavirus.

We’re not sure who wrote this Facebook post. The earliest version we could find was posted by Dr. James Fedich, but we’ve come across several other variations of the list across social media. We reached out to Fedich to confirm authorship but we have not yet heard back. 
More importantly, this list appears to be generally accurate. Some of the statements are missing some context, are a bit exaggerated, or appear to be little more than wishful thinking, so let’s take a brief look at each of the claims individually:
China has closed down its last coronavirus hospital. Not enough new cases to support them. 
China built several temporary hospitals in order to care for people sickened by COVID-19. On March 11, journalists reported that these hospitals were shut down as the  spread of the disease started to slow. On March 19, China reported no new locally transmitted cases had been reported for the first time since the start of the pandemic:

— China Daily (@ChinaDaily) March 11, 2020

Doctors in India have been successful in treating Coronavirus. Combination of drugs used: Lopinavir, Retonovir, Oseltamivir along with Chlorphenamine. They are going to suggest same medicine, globally. 
The Economic Times reported that the combination of two anti-HIV drugs had proven crucial to the treatment of coronavirus patients. India’s Union of Health Ministry revised its guidelines to recommend the use of “anti-HIV drug combinations Lopinavir and Ritonavir on a case-to-case basis depending upon the severity of the condition of a patient having coronavirus infection.”
But it’s unclear how effective these drugs will end up being or if they will be implemented in treatment worldwide. 
Researchers of the Erasmus Medical Center claim to have found an antibody against coronavirus.
The Dutch newspaper NL Times reported that “a team of ten scientific researchers from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and Utrecht University” reported that they discovered an “antibody capable of fending off an infection by the Covid-19 variant of coronavirus.”
This may prove to be a big step in developing a vaccine for COVID-19. 
A 103-year-old Chinese grandmother has made a full recovery from COVID-19 after being treated for 6 days in Wuhan, China.
The Independent reported on March 11 that a 103-year-old woman named Zhang Guangfen contracted the disease in Wuhan, China. Guangfen was treated for six days at the hospital before being released. Dr. Zeng Yulan told reporters that the centenarian’s quick recovery was likely due to the fact that he had no underlying health conditions. 
Apple reopens all 42 China stores.
Although China was once the epicenter of this pandemic, the country managed to get a handle on the situation, and as of this writing cases in the country continue to drop. On March 13, 2020, Apple announced that it was reopening all 42 of its stores in China. 
Reuters reported: “Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is reopening all 42 of its branded stores in China on Friday [March 13], a company spokesman said, more than a month after they were shut in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.”
Cleveland Clinic developed a COVID-19 test that gives results in hours, not days.
The MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, announced on March 16 that it can test COVID-19 samples at its laboratory and get the results in just two hours. These tests, however, were in very limited supply:
MetroHealth CEO and President Akram Boutros, MD, FACHE, said: “Supplies are very limited, and testing at this time must be reserved for the hospitalized patients who are critically ill and those who have had direct contact with them.”
Good news from South Korea, where the number of new cases is declining.
While COVID-19 continues, currently, to spread in places like the United States, some other countries have managed to “flatten the curve” and suppress the spread of the disease.
Science Magazine wrote on March 17: “Amid these dire trends, South Korea has emerged as a sign of hope and a model to emulate. The country of 50 million appears to have greatly slowed its epidemic; it reported only 74 new cases today, down from 909 at its peak on 29 February. And it has done so without locking down entire cities or taking some of the other authoritarian measures that helped China bring its epidemic under control.”
One reason for South Korea’s success, according to CNN, is that the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a population of relatively young, non-smoking women. 
Italy is hit hard, experts say, only because they have the oldest population in Europe.
While South Korea may have benefited from this disease impacting its young population first, Italy, on the other hand, has one of the oldest populations on earth. 
Wired reported: “Italy has been hit particularly hard, with some 2,000 deaths thus far. Overwhelmed hospital staffers have had to make devastating decisions about who to treat and who they must let perish. The reason why Italy is suffering so badly, write University of Oxford researchers in a new paper in the journal Demographic Science, may be twofold: The country has the second-oldest population on earth, and its young tend to mingle more often with the elderly, like their grandparents. Such demographic research will be critical in facing down the threat elsewhere, as more countries grapple with a deadly pandemic that’s just getting started and we learn more about how the virus is transmitted within families and communities.”
Scientists in Israel likely to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine.
Haaertz reported on March 18 that “scientists at Israel’s Institute for Biological Research” have made a “significant breakthrough,” and that they could announce in the next few days that they have completed development of a vaccine. 
Haaertz said: “According to medical sources, the scientists have recently had a significant breakthrough in understanding the biological mechanism and qualities of the virus, including better diagnostic capability, production of antibodies for those who already have the virus and development of a vaccine.”
However, it will still be awhile before this vaccine reaches a larger population. 
Haaertz added: “The development process requires a series of tests and experiments that may last many months before the vaccination is deemed effective or safe to use.”
3 Maryland coronavirus patients fully recovered; able to return to everyday life.
Fox 5 DC reported on March 14 that Maryland’s first three coronavirus patients had all recovered and were returning to their homes.

A network of Canadian scientists are making excellent progress in Covid-19 research.
The Montreal Gazette reported on March 13 that the country’s scientists were making progress on COVID-19 research as they were able to isolate a copy of the coronavirus. 
“A team of Canadian researchers from Ontario has isolated and grown copies of the coronavirus, the agent responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 that has spread worldwide,” the Gazette said. “The isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and to gain a fuller understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).”
A San Diego biotech company is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with Duke University and National University of Singapore.
A CBS TV station reported on March 12 that the San Diego biotech company Arcturus Therapeutics was working on a COVID-19 vaccine. 
The outlet reported: “As the race to develop a vaccine for coronavirus / COVID-19 continues globally, the San Diego based biotech company, Arcturus Therapeutics, is working on creating one at its Torrey Pines lab … The biotech company is working with Duke NUS- Medical School, a partnership between Duke University and the National University of Singapore.”
Tulsa County’s first positive COVID-19 case has recovered. This individual has had two negative tests, which is the indicator of recovery.
Tulsa World reported on March 12 that the county’s first coronavirus case had fully recovered. The Tulsa Health Department reported the good news on Facebook:

The Hindu reported on March 14 that seven coronavirus patients at Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi had recovered from the disease, writing: “Safdarjung Hospital, which is treating a bulk of COVID-19 patients here in the Capital has reported that seven of the positive cases currently admitted in the hospital have recovered but are yet to be discharged.” 
Plasma from newly recovered patients from Covid-19 can treat others infected by Covid-19.
The final item on this list refers to an experimental treatment. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that the FDA was experimenting with a new COVID-19 treatment involving the plasma from a person who recovered from the disease:
Tech Crunch reported:
Hahn also highlighted another experimental treatment possibility that the FDA is investigating: Using plasma derived from blood taken from coronavirus patients who have recovered, and injecting that into other patients in an attempt to potentially jump start their own immune response.
“There’s a cross-agency effort about something called convalescent plasma,” he said. “This is a pretty exciting area. And again, this is something that we have given assistance to other countries with as this crisis has developed, so FDA has been working for some time on this. If you’ve been exposed to coronavirus and you’re better, you don’t have the virus in your blood. We could collect the blood now, this is a possible treatment. This is not a proven treatment, I just want to emphasize that, [but we would] collect the blood, concentrate that and have the ability, once it’s pathogen-free, that is virus-free, be able to give that to other patients and the immunoglobulins, the immune response could potentially provide a benefit to patients.”
In Summary
The claims on the popular “good news” list are generally accurate and supported by credible news reports. The number of new cases in China and South Korea have dropped since the pandemic began, enough so that China has closed its temporary hospitals. A number of patients have also successfully recovered from the disease, and several organizations are working on vaccines for COVID-19. However, at the time of this writing (March 19, 2020), this “good news” should not be taken as proof that this pandemic is soon coming to an end. Health officials in the United States continue to urge citizens to practice “social distancing,” and it’s likely that we won’t see a worldwide rollout of an effective vaccine until mid-2021.",mostly-true

Oscar, a digital health-insurance startup that recently set up a service for users to find COVID-19 testing centers, was co-founded by Joshua Kushner.
As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Tell us about any questionable, confusing, or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter. 

Compared to the output of most other developed countries, the United States’ ability to test for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has been extremely limited. This reality has led to rumors that President Donald Trump’s administration, or some of its members, have a financial interest in promoting specific tests as opposed to others that would be more widely available or more easily distributed.
One claim that has emerged in this vein came from a report by Raw Story that asserted “the Kushner family is trying to cash in on the pandemic that could kill millions of us.” The basis for this claim concerns the health insurance startup Oscar co-founded by Jared Kushner’s brother, Joshua Kushner. Jared Kushner is the son-in-law of and special adviser to Trump.
Oscar Health’s COVID-19 Testing Locator
On March 13, 2020, Oscar announced that it would be launching a testing-center locator for COVID-19:
Today, Oscar, a tech-driven health insurance company, launched the first testing center locator for COVID-19 in the U.S., featuring more than 100 centers today. It is accessible to the general public and more testing centers are being added every day.
However, the details of Oscar’s testing locator have been described incorrectly in several viral social media posts alleging profiteering from the Kushners during the coronavirus pandemic. A well-shared post by a user named “Boston Judy,” for example, asserted that “we didn’t have testing because the Trump family circle wanted to wait till they could make a profit.”

Even if this assertion had merit, the actions Oscar took merely help locate unaffiliated testing centers. As an insurance company, Oscar does not manufacture, perform, analyze, or sell any actual COVID-19 test. Further, the test-center locator that Oscar developed is open to the general public and is not limited to people who get insurance through Oscar. Once a user has taken a short survey, the locator will provide the closest locations for testing in areas in which they operate. While the service also acts as a promotion for the company, it can serve as a testing center locator for any interested party.
Will Oscar Health Profit from COVID-19?
“Boston Judy” later clarified that Oscar was not producing tests, but that the company would get to “bill the feds for evaluating people for COVID and referring them to a testing center if they meet the criteria [for testing].” While the legislation that would allow for such a reimbursement likely will include a fund for covering the cost of these tests, the legislation has not yet been finalized, and it’s unclear that it would really be a windfall for Oscar, either.
On March 13, 2020, U.S. House Democrats and the White House reached a deal on a package of legislation that included a requirement that insurance companies cover the full cost of COVID-19 with no cost sharing. As described by the Brookings Institute, this legislation, if and when it is passed by the Senate and signed by the president:
Would offer financial support to state governments by temporarily increasing the share of Medicaid spending financed by the federal government, require almost all forms of health insurance to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing, and create mechanisms to pay for COVID-19 testing for uninsured people.
In other words, while the government will likely be subsidizing insurance companies like Oscar, they are doing so to cover losses incurred by the requirement for full reimbursement to members. These laws, and the federal reimbursement they would authorize, would apply to any health insurance company in America, not only Oscar.
Does Jared Kushner Have Anything to Do With Oscar?
Joshua Kushner co-founded Oscar in 2012. His venture capital firm, Thrive Capital, holds a significant ownership share. According to financial-disclosure forms released by Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, covering the year 2018, the couple owned and received profit from shares of Thrive:

This document also appears to assert that the couple divested from Thrive during the 2018 financial year:

Jared Kushner recently divested from another of his brother’s enterprises: the “real estate crowdfunding platform” Cadre. In that instance, the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) obtained a certificate of divestiture documenting Jared Kushner’s involvement in that company. Thus far, however, no certificate of divestiture has been produced publicly that documents Jared Kushner’s divestment in the company that owns Oscar.
That being said, the assertion that the Kushners as a family are involved in the business of COVID-19 testing is not entirely accurate. The company’s coronavirus response so far is limited to an online form that allows users to find a testing location if their symptoms call for it. Health insurance companies are likely to be reimbursed for covering the cost of COVID-19 testing once legislation is passed, but this would apply to all insurance providers, not just Oscar. For these reasons, we rank the truth of this claim as a “Mixture.”",mixture
6100.0,People with Type-A blood are more susceptible to COVID-19.,"Are People With Type-A Blood More Susceptible to COVID-19?
Such an observation would have an impact on how medical professionals identify those most at risk of the disease.
On March 11, 2020, researchers in China released a preliminary draft of a study that collected data on the ABO blood types of 2,173 patients with lab-verified cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease from two hospitals in Wuhan and one in Shenzhen. The researchers compared the distribution of blood types in the infected patients to the distribution of blood types of uninfected people (as a control group) from Wuhan City and Shenzhen City.
The team analyzed the data in an effort to answer two questions. First, if infection from COVID-19 appeared disproportionately high or low in any blood group; and second, if instances of death from COVID-19 had any relationship to blood type. The researchers found that:

People with blood Type-A blood were more susceptible to both infection and death from COVID-19.
People with blood Type-O were less susceptible to both infection and death from COVID-19.

These results, which the authors cautioned should not be used to guide clinical practice, came with several caveats. First, this study is a draft of a research paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in any journal. Second, the study is limited in both sample size and geographic scope. Speaking to the South China Morning Post, Gao Yingdai, a Tianjin-based researcher not involved in the study, said that while a 2,000-person sample is not necessarily small, it is dwarfed by the number of cases globally. 
Tara Moriarty, an expert in infectious diseases and immunopathology with the University of Toronto, told us by email that the study provides “an interesting observation that may have an impact on how we identify those most at risk of disease, but until it has been fully peer-reviewed and confirmed/disconfirmed by additional studies, we cannot yet say if blood type affects susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.”
Gao, the Tianjin-based researcher, echoed this point with the Morning Post, saying the results “may be helpful to medical professionals, but ordinary citizens should not take the statistics too seriously” and that “If you are type A, there is no need to panic.”
ABO blood type is determined by the presence or absence of specific proteins or sugars known as antibodies found in the plasma component of blood, as well as the presence or absence of proteins or sugars known as antigens found on the surface of red blood cells. Several viral infections, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), appear to have a certain affinity for specific blood types. “Blood type groups are associated with differences in vulnerability to infection with multiple viruses, and severity of outcomes, Moriarity told us. “Examples include HIV, viruses that cause gastrointestinal illness (norovirus, rotavirus), as well as the SARS coronavirus that caused the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.”
The exact mechanism behind difference in how viruses respond to blood types is not well-understood, but may involve how antigens and antibodies inhibit or promote a virus binding to the surface of a cell, Moriarity said.
In short, ample scientific evidence exists for the hypothesis that COVID-19 — or other infections — could affect people differently depending on their blood type. However, such a conclusion cannot be made confidently on the basis of a single study that has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a journal. As such, we rank this claim about blood types as “Unproven.”",FALSE

6118.0,Eating bananas is a preventative against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.,"Will Eating Bananas Prevent Coronavirus Infection?
Bananas are a good source of various nutrients, but eating them doesn't offer solid protection against COVID-19.
Amidst the plethora of misleading preventatives and cures for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease offered online during the pandemic of early 2020 was a video posted to Facebook which suggested that consuming bananas could ward off infection by the novel coronavirus:




However, the video did not stem from any reputable news agency, nor did it offer anything documenting that the consumption of bananas was an effective preventative against COVID-19.  It misleadingly combined clips from a January 2020 ABC Australia news segment and a February 2020 Wall Street Journal news video about efforts by scientists at the University of Queensland and the National Institutes of Health to develop a coronavirus vaccine, interspersed with added inserts and overlays about bananas that touted the supposed health benefits of the fruit, as follows:

Bananas are one of the most popular fruits worldwide.  such as Vitamin C. All of these support health.  people who follow a high fiber diet have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.  Bananas contain water and fiver, both of which promote regularity and encourage digestive health.  Research made by scientists and the University of Queensland in Australia have proven that bananas improve your immune system due to the super source of Vitamins B-6 and helps prevent coronavirus.  Having a banana a day keeps the coronavirus away.

It is true that bananas, consumed in moderation, are fairly good sources of fiber, dietary potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C, all of which are important components of a healthy diet.
However, other than contributing in a modest way to general good health, the consumption of bananas does not specifically do anything to “prevent coronavirus,” nor have scientists at the University of Queensland asserted any such claim.
The most effective methods to protect yourself against contracting COVID-19 do not involve eating any specific food, but rather maintaining a safe distance from others who might spread the virus to you and regularly following basic sanitary/hygienic procedures:

o Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
o Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
o Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
o Don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean",FALSE
6119.0,"The COVID-19 coronavirus disease is ""spreading quickly from gas pumps.","Is COVID-19 Being Spread Through Gas Pumps?
Gas pump handles are one of many common objects that could be contaminated, so consumers should take reasonable precautions to avoid exposure.
In March 2020, during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, social media users began sharing warnings about the virus’ allegedly “spreading quickly from gas pumps.”  Such warnings cautioned readers to use gloves or paper towels while pumping gas and to discard them immediately afterward:

One particular version of this class of warning attributed the advice to “Galway Hospital” in Ireland:

However, University Hospital Galway told TheJournal.ie that “we’ve not issued any such advice.”
As for the content of the message (regardless of its source), as with many coronavirus-related pieces of advice, it’s something of a mixed bag.
We’re not aware of any credible reports of COVID-19 being spread via gas pump handles (something that would likely be difficult to determine as the specific source of any particular infection).  It is true that surface contact is one of the means of transmission of the novel coronavirus, and since gas pumps are objects that are typically handled by many different people throughout the course of a day — in many places without being regularly cleaned between uses (especially in areas where self-service is the norm) — they are a potential route for the virus to spread from person to person. 
How much risk pumping gas poses relative to other ordinary day-to-day activities is difficult to determine.  Consumer Reports, for example, offered advice consistent with what was expressed in social media warnings:

For many [persons] the occasional trip to the gas station is inevitable, as is touching the pump handle and payment keypad. Pump handles and credit card keypads, which are high-touch areas, could have the virus present, which experts say can stay alive for hours or even days on hard surfaces …
[T]here are a few things you can do that will help you stay safe when you have to pump gas.
• Consider carrying some disposable nitrile or latex gloves in your car to use when gripping the pump handle. Short of that, you can try to use paper towels that are sometimes available at the pump or have some with you to cover your hands when you grip the handle. 
• Invert the gloves and throw them away, and also any paper towels you might have used. Use hand sanitizer to make sure your hands are clean after you’re done and before you get back into your car.

On the other hand, TheJournal.ie quoted the Irish Petroleum Industry Association as dismissive of the advice in the social media messages:

Our members are implementing enhanced hygiene protocols in our service station shops. In line with HSE [Health and Safety Executive] advice, our workers regularly wash and sanitise their hands and the areas customers interact with such as fuel nozzles, credit card PIN pads, door handles and food areas.
We are aware of messages being shared on social media and wanted to inform customers that pump handles are no more or less prone to the spread of infection than any other hard surface and to outline the significant steps we are taking to combat the spread of Covid-19 and keep our valued customers safe.

Gas pumps could be considered somewhat more of a concern because consumers typically touch other surfaces — such as the door handles and interiors of their vehicles — immediately afterwards and could thereby create yet another pathway of contamination for themselves or others.  However, gas pumps are just one of many objects that multiple people commonly handle in similar fashion during the course of a day, including ATMs, payment processing systems, shopping cart handles, and currency, all of which pose varying degrees of risk.
How much potential for spreading the coronavirus any such object may present depends in large part on whether it’s properly cleaned between uses, something that the public may not know (and should not bank on).  In general, the best advice is to wipe down surfaces you need to touch with disinfectant wipes, and don’t touch your face or anything at home until you’ve washed your hands thoroughly afterwards:

John Eichberger, executive director of the nonprofit Fuels Institute, says gas station owners and operators are doing what they can to combat the spread of COVID-19 by cleaning their facilities more often. But that might not be enough assurance for some motorists.
“If consumers are really worried about touching a gas pump handle, they can do what they do when they go to a grocery store and wipe down surfaces with disinfectant wipes when they need to touch something,” Eichberger says.
And as you would after any trip outside your home during this unusual time, remember to wash your hands before touching anything at home.",mixture

We received multiple inquiries from readers about the videos, which were featured in various news articles describing the footage as showing military trucks transporting coffins away from a crematorium in the northern city of Bergamo, because the local death rate from the virus had exceeded its capacity.

6121.0,The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the United States and South Korea on the same day.,"Was COVID-19 Discovered in the US and South Korea on the Same Day?
These two countries took different approaches in the early days of the pandemic and saw vastly different results.
In March 2020, as the daily rate of new cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease was increasing in the United States and decreasing in South Korea, a message started to circulate on social media claiming that these two countries had seen their first confirmed cases of infection by the novel coronavirus on the same day:

South Korea and the United States did indeed confirm their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day, Jan. 20, 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first South Korean case of COVID-19 was detected in a 35-year-old woman who had been living in Wuhan, China:
On 20 January 2020, National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for Republic of Korea reported the first case of novel coronavirus in the Republic of Korea. The case is a 35-year-old female, Chinese national, residing in Wuhan, Hubei province in China.
That same day, a 35-year-old man who had recently returned to the United States from Wuhan, China, was also diagnosed with the disease. The New England Journal of Medicine reported:
On January 20, 2020, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] confirmed that the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.
The CDC announced that it had confirmed the first U.S. case of COVID-19 in a press release the following day, and a CDC spokesperson told Snopes.com that the patient tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the evening of Jan. 20. The press release came the following morning to give health officials time to notify the patient and discuss the special circumstances of the case. 
While these countries both detected their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day, they took different approaches to treating the disease and have so far seen vastly different results. At the time of this writing on March 23, 2020, the number of cases in the U.S. had topped 35,000. South Korea had less than 9,000 cases and reported its lowest number of new cases since rates peaked at the end of February.
One possible explanation as to why South Korea was relatively successful in combating the disease, while the United States struggled to keep it contained during its initial weeks, may have to do with how each country reacted in the earliest days of the impending pandemic. In brief, South Korea’s first action to fight the spread of COVID-19 was to aggressively start testing people for the disease and quarantine those who tested positive. The United States’ first actions were aimed at restricting travel from China. 
A special report from Reuters noted that South Korean health officials gathered in late January 2020 and decided that the need for testing was urgent. South Korea’s CDC approved its first diagnostic test the following week, and by the end of February, drive-thru testing facilities that screened thousands of people a day were in operation. 
The United States took a different approach. 
When the first patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States in January 2020, President Donald Trump announced a set of travel restrictions on Jan. 31, 2020, that prohibited travelers from arriving from China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The restrictions also required American citizens returning home from China to be screened at airports and monitored for 14 days after their arrival. 
While the Trump administration did take action to combat the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first patient was diagnosed in the U.S., the country did not, as South Korea did, immediately ramp up diagnostic testing. According to Reuters, South Korea conducted nearly 300,000 tests within two months of diagnosing their first COVID-19 patient. By contrast, the U.S. only conducted about 60,000 tests in that same time period.
Reuters reported (on March 18):
South Korea’s swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.
The United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea’s, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.
The spread of COVID-19 will undoubtedly be studied in greater detail, but we may not know the specific reasons as to why the disease spread the way it did in different locations for some time. However, the fact remains that while the United States and South Korea both confirmed their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day (Jan. 20, 2020), but the United States struggled to slow the spread of the disease in the same time period that South Korea was largely successful at mitigating its spread.",TRUE

As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Browse our coronavirus fact checks here. Tell us about any questionable or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter here.

In March 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media claiming that the world has been using a vaccine for coronavirus on cattle for years, and that the current panic about a growing COVID-19 pandemic was being overblown by the media:

However, as of this writing, no vaccine currently exists for the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease.
The confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the word “coronavirus.” While this word was frequently used in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to describe the virus that causes the new disease, “coronavirus” is actually a broad term that refers to a group of viruses.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes:
“Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.
“Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. [There are] seven coronaviruses that can infect people…”
The above-displayed photograph does show a real vaccine used to treat bovine coronavirus. This vaccine, however, is not effective in humans or against the new strain of coronavirus that emerged at the end of 2019. 
This product, called ScourGard 4K, is for the “vaccination of healthy, pregnant cows and heifers as an aid in preventing diarrhea in their calves caused by bovine rotavirus (serotypes G6 and G10), bovine coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli having the K99 pili adherence factor.”
Ming Tan, a faculty member of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, told PolitiFact that:
The coronavirus used in the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine is distinct from the current coronavirus.
“The antibodies produced by the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine will not recognize the current “coronavirus” and thus will not protect humans from infection.”
Although the disease at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic was often referred to as simply “coronavirus” in the early days of 2020, a more scientific name has since emerged. According to the World Health Organization, the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease is referred to as COVID-19. 
To sum up: The word “coronavirus” refers to a group of viruses, not one specific pathogen. A vaccine that is developed for a particular strain of coronavirus, such as bovine coronavirus, SARS, or MERS, is not necessarily going to be effective against other variations in this group. At the moment, no vaccine exists for SARS-CoV-2. For these reasons, we rate this claim “False.”",FALSE
6125.0,A new disease outbreak caused by the hantavirus has been detected in China.,"Does China Have a ‘New’ Outbreak of Hantavirus?
Hantavirus has been known to exist for decades.
A man who passed away in China’s Yunnan Province tested positive for hantavirus, a rare type of virus transmitted from rodents to humans, and news reports about that event raised fears that a new disease outbreak was looming.
The reports came in late March 2020, as the world was reeling from the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the spread of a novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in the winter of 2019. Much of the hantavirus anxiety appears to have been sparked by a tweet from Global Times, an English-language publication based in China.

The tweet sparked viral memes and fears that, even as hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 cases are being reported worldwide and illnesses and deaths caused by the coronavirus continue to rise in the United States, a second disease outbreak was looming. Here is an example of a meme spreading on Twitter in late March (the user’s name has been cropped out to protect privacy):
However, a single reported case of hantavirus in China does not an outbreak make, and hantaviruses are hardly new. They go back decades and aren’t transmitted between humans like COVID-19. Instead, hantaviruses are spread from rodents to humans, and cases are extremely rare. The first strain of hantavirus was recorded during the Korean war, when it killed 190 American G.I.’s and sickened about 3,000.
With rare exception, rodents are the hosts that transmit the disease to humans, through “urine, feces, and saliva, and less frequently by a bite from an infected host,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The most common type of hantavirus illness found in the United States is Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), the CDC says, and again, it’s rare. HPS was first discovered by health professionals in 1993 in the Southwest region of the U.S. Researchers traced the earliest case to the death of a 38-year-old man in Utah in 1959. From 1993 to 2017, the U.S. had 728 known cases, per the CDC.
HPS is serious, resulting in fever, muscle aches, and pneumonia. It has a mortality rate of 38%, which is drastically higher than the 0.1% mortality rate of the seasonal flu.
A second type of illness caused by a hantavirus is Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS). This disease is found mostly in Eastern Asia and Europe, but not in the Americas.
In contrast to hantavirus illnesses, COVID-19 has encircled the globe in a matter of months since its initial detection in late 2019. As of this writing on March 24, 2020, more than 400,000 cases worldwide and 50,000 in the U.S. have been reported.
Because hantavirus is not new and because it isn’t transmitted between humans, no one should fear that a new outbreak of disease caused by hantavirus is looming. We therefore rate this claim “False.”",mostly-false

7414.0,"Waking up a sleepwalker could cause the person to have a heart attack, go into a coma, or experience other serious medical conditions.","Should You Avoid Waking a Sleepwalker?
An old myth holds that waking a sleepwalker could cause serious harm.
In late October 2020, a video on the social media platform TikTok went viral. It appeared to show a man in the process of sleepwalking as he mimes eating with a fork in his hand. The man is startled awake when the person holding the camera shouts at him, and he reflexively throws the fork at her.
Although both people in the video appeared to be unharmed in the incident, it resurfaced a long-standing myth that waking a sleepwalker could cause them harm. Some believe that waking a sleepwalker can, by itself, trigger serious conditions like a heart attack or coma.
Simply waking up a sleepwalker won’t in and of itself medically harm them, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). But AASM warns that much like anyone suddenly awakened, in a strange location no less, the sleepwalker will likely be confused or even angry.
The best way to remedy a sleepwalking situation is to gently guide the person back to bed without waking them.
It’s fairly common for children to experience sleepwalking — the younger they are, the more likely. But most people grow out of it as they get older, according to AASM.
AASM defines sleepwalking, or somnambulism, as a sleep disorder affecting up to 4% of adults. The condition consists of, “a series of complex behaviors that culminate in walking around with an altered state of consciousness and impaired judgment.”
People who sleepwalk can unconsciously perform activities that endanger themselves, like walking downstairs, leaving their homes, and even on rare occasions, driving cars. In one extreme case, a London teenager in 2005 sleep-climbed to the top of a 130-foot crane. She was found curled up atop the crane, sleeping.
At the time, the BBC reported:
Expert Irshaad Ebrahim, of the London Sleep Centre, told the Times newspaper he had treated people who had driven cars and ridden horses while asleep.

7427.0,Dr. Anthony Fauci blamed mask use for the majority of deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic.,"Did Fauci Blame Mask Use for 1918 ‘Spanish Flu’ Deaths?

In October 2020, after more than 225,000 people had died in the United States and after the repeated insistence from public health officials that mask use helped slow the spread of COVID-19, rumors continued to circulate on social media that attempted to negate the use of this simple protective device. One such rumor claimed that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), had written in a 2008 study that mask use was responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic. 

Another Facebook user wrote: “Dr. Fauci saying masks should be mandated. Even though in 2008 he wrote a paper saying the MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAY DIED IN THE 1918 SPANISH FLU DIED FROM SECONDARY BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE USE OF FACE MASKS.”
Fauci did not blame mask use for any deaths that occurred during the 1918 Spanish flu. In fact, the paper mentioned in the above-displayed Facebook posts doesn’t even mention masks. 
In October 2008, Fauci co-authored a paper published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases about the role that bacterial pneumonia played during the 1918 flu pandemic (commonly referred to by the misnomer “Spanish flu”). An estimated 50 million people died during the 1918 flu pandemic, with approximately 675,000 of those deaths taking place in the United States. The paper co-authored by Fauci in 2008 found that these deaths weren’t caused by the flu alone, but that the majority “likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia.”
Fauci said in a contemporary news release:
“The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths … In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.”
While some social media users presented this study as a cautionary tale against mask use — incorrectly claiming that it was the masks that were responsible for the development of bacteria — Fauci’s paper actually highlighted the need to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well as antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines in order to properly combat a pandemic. 
Another excerpt from this news release explained:
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.
A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online. Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.
In other words, this paper did not blame mask use for causing these bacterial infections. That connection — that mask use is actually dangerous because it causes bacterial infections — was made by social media users and is one that has been repeatedly shot down by experts.
In June 2020, The Associated Press investigated the false claim that mask use leads to bacterial pneumonia. Davidson Hamer, infectious disease specialist and professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said at the time:
“There’s no evidence of masks leading to fungal or bacterial infections of the upper airway or the lower airway as in pneumonia.”
[…]
There’s no evidence that wearing face masks cause any harm besides some discomfort, Hamer said. However, he added paper masks that become visibly wet should be discarded.
[…]
“It’s so highly unlikely with normal mask use. There’s a real danger at spreading incorrect information like this, especially at a time when we really need to be encouraging more people to wear masks.”
Reuters spoke with the global team of health experts at LeanAboutCovid19.com, and were told that there was “no evidence” that regular mask use increased the risk of developing any “bacterial, fungal or viral infection in the lung.” 
A statement from LeanAboutCovid19.com reads:
“In fact, according to a study published in the Preventive Medicine journal, wearing face masks is shown to protect people against bacterial infections in hospital settings, where health care workers are most prone to antibiotic-resistant  bacteria.”
Doctors at Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Lawrence, Kansas, also addressed this claim in an article debunking common mask myths. While one doctor noted that it was important to clean masks to prevent bacterial build-up, both noted that regular mask use does not lead to bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. 
Am I breathing in more bacteria or virus if I wear a mask? 
Dr. Brychel: If utilized and cared for properly, no. However, it is important that you either clean or exchange your mask at least once a day because masks can accumulate environmental particles, including virus, bacteria and fungi.
Dr. Penn: No. There is no evidence that masks lead to bacterial, fungal or viral infections of the upper or lower airway. However, masks that become soiled should be replaced and masks should not be worn for more than one day before laundering (if cloth) or replacing.
In short:  In 2008, Fauci co-authored a report stating that the majority of deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic “likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia.” This paper did not state that this secondary bacterial pneumonia had been caused by mask use. In addition to the fact that this study doesn’t mention or deal with masks, a multitude of experts have since dismissed the notion that masks increase the risk of bacterial infections.",FALSE

6149.0,Drinking hot water with lemons will cure or prevent COVID-19; drinking hot water with lemons and sodium bicarbonate will “alkalize the immune system” and cure or prevent COVID-19.,"Will Lemons and Hot Water Cure or Prevent COVID-19?
As cures go, these ones are lemons.
As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Browse our coronavirus fact checks here. Tell us about any questionable or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter here.

A significant amount of COVID-19 coronavirus disease misinformation spreading across social media or chat apps takes the form of copied-and-pasted “advice” posts attributed to anonymous “experts”. These posts are usually riddled with scientific errors and/or promises of cures. Here we look at two such “cure” posts that involve hot water and lemons.
The Claims
One claim, attributed to a Chinese researcher, implores readers to “use as much natural vitamin C” as possible and suggests lemons as a good source. To that point, the post claims that regular consumption of a drink made from three lemon slices and hot water helps “against the spread of [COVID-19]” and “destroys the virus.” While vitamin C does play a role in several immune system functions, its use as a treatment to prevent or cure viral infections is unsupported by science.
A second, slightly modified claim is attributed to “information” that “comes from Israel” and includes the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the hot lemon water cure. Unlike the previous assertion, which rests largely on claims about vitamin C, this cure allegedly works because it can “alkalize the immune system.” The ubiquity of this concoction in Israel, the post additionally claims, is why the country has seen no cases of the disease. This is false. “Alkalizing the immune system” is an illogical pseudoscientific concept, and at this time of this reporting, Israel had over 2,300 confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Can Hot Lemon ‘Kill the Spread of This Virus’?
This dubious claim, which now circulates in text form on social media platforms, has its origins in a video shared extensively on Facebook messenger and created by the owner of the YouTube channel “MrHealthyChannel.” Even before any medical information is presented, several red flags are apparent. “Hi, I am Jiao Shenme Mingzi from China, Researcher at the School of Medicine Zanjan University,” the post begins. Zanjan University is in Iran, and, as PolitiFact noted, this person’s alleged name closely resembles the phonetic spelling of “jiao shenme mingzi,” which is not a name but a phrase used to ask for someone’s name.
The video and posts derived from transcripts of that video falsely assert that the reason we lack a medical cure for COVID-19, and therefore need a natural remedy that contains vitamin C, is a result of the novel coronavirus’ unexpected or rapid genetic mutation (an issue Snopes addressed here). In reality, this virus is dangerous because of its ability, like other infection-causing viruses, to sustain and replicate in human cells, particularly those of the upper respiratory system.
Though early work had suggested vitamin C as a treatment for the common cold, which is also a viral upper respiratory infection, later work has cast doubt on that notion. In general, no scientific research has shown an ability for vitamin C supplementation to “kill” any upper-respiratory system virus or to reduce its spread. As summarized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), “the evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/per day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population.” For reference, that single lemon cut into three slices and served with hot water contains about 30 milligrams of vitamin c.
The NIH does suggest that “vitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity” as well as provide some potential benefit to certain populations of people with compromised immune systems. As Dr. Caroline Apovian, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, explained to USA Today, “The only impact that vitamins and supplements may have in any cold or flu is to lessen the severity.”  As such, the assertion that a single lemon served with hot water will “kill the spread of this virus in our body” is unsupported by science.
Can Lemon Help ‘Alkalize the Immune System’?
This iteration of the lemon and hot water cure comes from a viral copy-pasted-and-reshared bit of text on Facebook that usually begins with the false statement that the information comes “from Israel where this virus did not cause any deaths.” As previously noted, Israel has in no way been immune to the coronavirus pandemic, nor are they, as the post also asserts, “relaxed about the virus.” On March 25, the Israeli government announced — like other governments around the world — measures to limit the movement of its citizens in order to slow the disease’s spread.
The alleged science here is just as straightforward to debunk. The ability to “alkalize” one’s body was a popular claim promoted by scientists in the 1920s and by supplement peddlers and health gurus today. But unless you suffer from certain specific and medically catastrophic conditions like metabolic acidosis, it is effectively impossible to alter, through diet, the pH of the cellular environment that makes up the various tissues of your body, including those of the immune system. The body maintains these environments in a tightly controlled range: a pH between 7.36 and 7.44 in arteries, and around 7.2 in intracellular spaces. The only pH value in your body that you would be altering with your diet is the pH of your urine. Such a modification would provide no medical benefit to the fight against a viral infection.
The Bottom Line
Lemon and hot water used as a vitamin C therapy will not “kill” or “slow the spread” of COVID-19, nor would it provide a clinically significant amount of vitamin C to begin with. A buffered solution of hot lemon juice and sodium bicarbonate, similarly, will do nothing to change the pH of either your body or your immune system. For these reasons both lemon-related “cures” are rated “False.”",FALSE

7442.0,Roughly 1 in 4 women in the United States have at least one abortion in their lifetime.,"Do ‘1 in 4’ Women Undergo an Abortion in Their Lifetime?
A commonly cited statistic had a resurgence on social media in October 2020.
In 2019 and 2020, readers asked Snopes to examine the widely shared claim that “1 in 4” women undergo an abortion during their lifetime. In particular, readers cited a viral post on the Facebook page Hashtag, which read:
1 in 4 women will have an abortion in their lifetime. Maybe your mother, sister, cousin, best friend, etc… And while they may not shout it from the mountaintops, they’re reading your posts about how you think they’re garbage human beings for making a choice that they agonized over and was best for them. If it’s not your pregnancy, it’s not your business. And your lack of compassion does not go unnoticed. Mind your own uterus and stop worrying about something that has zero effect on you. 

The same message was shared multiple times on social media and online. The earliest example Snopes found was published on Feb. 2, 2019, but the meme experienced something of a revival in October 2020, for reasons that are unclear. 
The claim that “1 in 4 women” have an abortion in their lifetime has also been used by those opposed to abortion rights, such as Human Coalition:

The figure of “1 in 4 women” appears to derive from an estimate published in the American Journal of Public Health, a peer-reviewed journal, in 2017. As such, it has significant evidentiary backing. However, the data in that study were collected in 2014 and as such, they are at least six years old, as of 2020. Taking into account the possibility that the trend has changed in the past six years, we are issuing a rating of “Mostly True.”
Analysis
The study in question was entitled “Population Group Abortion Rates and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion: United States, 2008–2014” and was authored by Rachel Jones and Jenna Jerman from the research division of the Guttmacher Institute. The article was published in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) in November 2017 and can be read in full here. 
Although the meme in question does not contain a citation, it’s likely that it ultimately derives from Jones’ and Jerman’s research, since multiple reports by prominent news outlets and advocacy groups have cited the study in recent years.
The Guttmacher Institute is, in its own description, “committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States and globally.” As such, it is institutionally in favor of abortion rights. However, its research on abortion trends and legislation is widely regarded as rigorous and of a high standard, as demonstrated in this case by the AJPH’s acceptance of the 2017 study for publication.
A detailed explanation of the study’s methodology is available here, but in brief, the authors used data from the Guttmacher Institute’s 2014 Abortion Patient Survey in order to estimate the cumulative lifetime incidence of abortion among girls and women aged between 15 and 44. The study also used data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s monthly American Community Survey and the National Center for Health Statistics’ National Survey of Family Growth, in order to estimate the national prevalence of abortion. 
Ultimately, the authors estimated that 1.6 percent of girls aged between 15 and 17 had undergone at least one abortion; 4.6 of women aged 18 or 19; 13.3 percent of women aged between 20 and 24; 18.6 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds; 21.5 percent of 30-34 year-olds; 23.1 percent of 35- to 39-year-olds; and by age 44, 23.7 percent of women in the United States had undergone at least one abortion — hence the figure of “1 in 4” — as shown in the following table taken from Jones’ and Jerman’s study:

It’s important to bear in mind that that figure relates to 2014. The Guttmacher Institute confirmed for Snopes that they did not have more recent data on lifetime abortion incidence in the United States, so Jones’ and Jerman’s 2017 article is the best available evidence as of October 2020.
However, the lifetime incidence of abortion among women in the United States may have changed in the intervening six years, and there is good reason to believe it has declined.
According to Guttmacher Institute research, the overall abortion rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 women) in the United States was 21.3 in the year 2000. It dropped to 19.6 in 2008, and fell again to 14.6 in 2014, and again to 13.5 in 2017. If that long-term decline in the prevalence of abortion continued between 2017 and 2020, it stands to reason that the lifetime incidence of abortion also fell below the 23.7 percent estimated in 2014.",mostly-true

In late March 2020, social media users shared an article published by the website Mic with a headline that read, “An uninsured 17-year-old died after being denied care for coronavirus symptoms.” The headline was widely seen and caused outrage and anxiety over health care access amid an ongoing pandemic with a rising death toll.
Citing an article posted by the technology website Gizmodo, as well as comments from a local official, Mic reported, “The teen reportedly felt ill and sought treatment at an urgent care clinic, but was denied. The staff at the facility told the teen to try the emergency room at the local public hospital, Antelope Valley (AV) Hospital,” but the boy died while in transit to the hospital. The Antelope Valley is a community about 45 miles north of the city of Los Angeles.
The claim that the boy was denied medical care for COVID-19 symptoms due to a lack of health coverage originated with comments from Rex Parris, the mayor of the Antelope Valley city of Lancaster, in a video uploaded to the city’s YouTube page. In the video, Parris said the boy had gone to an urgent-care facility for an HMO (health maintenance organization). “He didn’t have insurance, so they did not treat him, and sent him to A.V. (Antelope Valley) Hospital.” The boy went into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital, Parris said in the video.
After the story went viral, however, Parris clarified his comments in a Facebook post. In that March 29, 2020, post, Parris referred to the boy only as “William” and noted he was the only person to die of the illness in the city as of that writing.
“We have learned more information about William’s death,” Parris wrote. “His family did have health insurance. When the family called his HMO, they were (correctly) told to take him to the emergency room. There was some initial confusion, possibly from language difficulties about the status of health insurance, but the family always had insurance. His family did everything possible to protect William, but this disease is fast and deadly.”
He reiterated much the same in an April 2 interview with Time Magazine. We reached out to Parris by email and have not yet received a response.",mixture

A common phenomenon that occurs during crises (e.g., natural disasters, political upheaval, terrorist attacks) is attempts by people to assert a sense of certainty and control over events by finding patterns in them, thereby suggesting that whatever is occurring — however chaotic or frightening it may be — is nonetheless natural, predictable, or manageable. So it was with the following meme, which was circulated during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in April 2020:

Although this meme couldn’t fairly be classified as “false” (since pandemics of some type were indeed extant during all four of the years it references), it isn’t particularly useful in any informative or predictive sense.
It’s an example of the common technique of creating the impression of a regular pattern by cherry-picking a small amount of (not necessarily relevant) data, while completely ignoring a much larger body of related data that doesn’t fit the desired pattern. Specifically:

The meme omitted every century ending in 20 prior to 1720, even though the occurrence of pandemics has been charted since long before the early 18th century.
The meme comprised only four entries, not a particularly impressive or convincing amount of data (especially in light of the above point).
The meme made no allowance for all the pandemics that spanned years other than those ending in 20 (which might suggest a completely different pattern, or none at all).
The listed pandemics shared no substantive commonality (such as underlying disease, geographic area, duration, extent) that was indicative of any meaningful pattern.

Nonetheless, for those who want to know how “true” the meme is, we offer the following summary of what its entries refer to:

Beginning in 1720, an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille, France (known as The Great Plague of Marseille) killed an estimated 100,000 people in that city and surrounding provinces and towns. However, that particular outbreak was far from the first, last, or most severe instance of bubonic plague in history. In particular, the Black Death — a bubonic plague epidemic that hit Eurasia in the 14th century — is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe’s human population (up to 50 million people), primarily from 1347 to 1351.
The first of several cholera pandemics recorded in modern history spread from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa in the early 19th century. However, that pandemic did not begin in 1820. It persisted from 1817 until 1824, and six more cholera pandemics were charted over the following 150 years.
The so-called “Spanish flu” or 1918 flu pandemic (influenza caused by an H1N1 virus) spread in the early 20th century, killing upwards of 50 million people worldwide. (Despite the name, most modern scholarship suggests the pandemic did not actually originate in Spain.) Once again, although that pandemic did encompass the year 1920, it began much earlier, continuing roughly from January 1918 to December 1920.
The COVID-19 coronavirus disease outbreak that made this image of interest in 2020 was initially reported at the end of 2019, but it was not officially characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization until March 2020.",mixture

There wasn’t a large amount missing from the bottle but I could smell it on her breath.
Within approx. 10 min. she was all glassy eyed and wobbly in her feet. As the minutes passed, she continued to get worse and got to the point where she couldn’t even stand up or walk, it was awful!!  
I called poison control immediately and they told me to take her to the ER right away due to the alcohol level in hand sanitizers.  As we were driving there her speech became slurred and harder to understand and her eyes looked awful. They admitted her and did urine and blood tests and it turns out that her blood alcohol level was .10 — which is legally drunk. It turns out that the hand sanitizers (Purell) have 62% alcohol in them and the dr. compared it to her drinking something that is 120 proof.  
We had a VERY scary afternoon but thankfully she is ok. We were in the ER until this evening, after spending the whole afternoon there, so they could monitor her and make sure her blood sugars were stable.  They said that someone her size would only need to have 3 squirts of it to get to the point of being .10 blood level.  
She has always wanted to lick her hands after we use it and we have warned her that it is dangerous and something that kids can’t do or they will end up in the hospital. Needless to say, we are going to go back to washing hands with soap and water because it is way to risky and scary to use this stuff seeing how little a child needs to be affected by it.  We asked about long term affected with the liver, brain, etc and the dr. said we have nothing to worry about but we need to get rid of all the hand sanitizer in the house.
Just wanted to let you all know so you can learn from our lesson and not have to go through something as scary as this…

Ok. I don’t know where to begin because the last 2 days of my life have been such a blur. Yesterday, My youngest daughter Halle who is 4, was rushed to the emergancy room by her father for being severely lethargic and incoherent. He was called to her school by the school secretary for being “very VERY sick.” He told me that when he arrived that Halle was barely sitting in the chair. She couldn’t hold her own head up and when he looked into her eyes, she couldn’t focus them.
He immediately called me after he scooped her up and rushed her to the ER. When we got there, they ran blood test after blood test and did x-rays, every test imaginable. Her white blood cell count was normal, nothing was out of the ordinary. The ER doctor told us that he had done everything that he could do so he was sending her to Saint Francis for further test. Right when we were leaving in the ambulance, her teacher had come to the ER and after questioning Halle’s classmates, we found out that she had licked hand sanitizer off her hand. Hand sanitizer, of all things.
But it makes sense. These days they have all kinds of differents scents and when you have a curious child, they are going to put all kinds of things in their mouths. When we arrived at Saint Francis, we told the ER doctor there to check her blood alcohol level, which, yes we did get weird looks from it but they did it. The results were her blood alcohol level was 85% and this was 6 hours after we first took her. Theres no telling what it would have been if we would have tested it at the first ER. Since then, her school and a few surrounding schools have taken this out of the classrooms of all the lower grade classes but whats to stop middle and high schoolers too? After doing research off the internet, we have found out that it only takes 3 squirts of the stuff to be fatal in a toddler. For her blood alcohol level to be so high was to compare someone her size to drinking something 120 proof. So please PLEASE don’t disregard this because I don’t ever want anyone to go thru what
my family and I have gone thru. Today was a little better but not much. Please send this to everyone you know that has children or are having children. It doesn’t matter what age. I just want people to know the
dangers of this.
Thank you
Lacey Butler and family
The first alert quoted above (which began circulating via e-mail in mid-January 2007) was written by Jennifer Moe, the mother of a 2-year-old girl who had ingested some hand sanitizer. The second example (May 2007) was written by Lacey Butler, the mother of a 4-year-old girl who had done the same; although it contains some errors of fact or transcription (e.g., a “blood alcohol level [measured at] 85%”), it is a true tale in the sense that 4-year-old Halle Butler, a pre-kindergarten student at Okmulgee Primary School in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, was treated at an area hospital after eating a small amount of hand sanitizer squirted into her palm by a teacher. 
While the stories as related in the e-mailed accounts fortunately did not result in death or serious injury, they are cautionary tales worth heeding because they present a scenario that can all too easily be repeated in other households, schools, or daycare centers with small children. Hand sanitizer gels and wipes include a surprising amount of alcohol (e.g., Purell and Germ-X contain 62% Ethyl Alcohol), and a child who swallowed enough of such products could experience what 2-year-old Sydney and 4-year-old Halle went through: intoxication, possibly even alcohol poisoning.
However, although such poisonings are possible, they are still quite rare due to the relatively large amount of bad-tasting sanitizer that a toddler would typically have to ingest to experience such harmful results:
“Typical exposure by a small child involves a squirt or two from a pump of 70 percent alcohol [sometimes labeled as ethanol] hand sanitizer [and] really isn’t usually a problem,” [Dr. Edward] Krenzelok [director of the Pittsburgh Poison Control Center & Drug Information Center and a professor of pharmacy and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh] explains. “They cry because it tastes bad and maybe it irritates their tongue,” he says. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, centers are receiving more of these calls as the use of hand sanitizers increases. Combined data from 2005 and 2006 found that poison-control centers reported more than 20,000 exposures to hand sanitizer, with more than 17,000 cases involving children under the age of 6. None of the calls resulted in death, with no major medical problems reported in the children. In fact, more than 9,500 cases resulted in little or no effect.
Bottles of topical anti-bacterials do carry explicit warnings about the danger they pose (e.g., bottles of Purell hand sanitizer caution: “Keep out of reach of children. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.”) However, unlike cleaning supplies and numerous other products commonly used in the home, hand sanitizer isn’t generally thought of as something that presents a poisoning danger to children — folks unthinkingly tend to regard it the way they do hand lotion, as something that can be safely left on a counter or nightstand. Yet such products shouldn’t be left within easy reach, not if one has a small child about. While one might think the taste of the product (which in Purell’s case is akin to a slightly flowery version of vodka) would keep children from swallowing too much of it, kids can and do get into the darnest things. 
Youngsters are especially at risk of ingesting poisons from ordinary household products due to four factors, notes a 1993 Clinical Pediatrics article:

 Children are naturally curious about most everything, including the taste, smell, and texture of products.
 Children learn about the world through smelling, touching, and tasting. Brightly colored liquids, spray containers, pills, and leafy or flowering plants are all attractive lures to children, who may attempt to learn more about them through spraying, smelling, or swallowing.  The mechanics of spray containers are of particular interest to many curious children.
 Children lack the experience and knowledge to distinguish poisons and other non-potables from harmless substances.  Children can think that fuels, cough syrup, and shampoo are safe to drink because they resemble beverages such as fruit punch or soft drinks. Children may also find the appearance, taste, or odor of a dangerous substance similar to that of a consumable product: medicine tablets look and taste like candy, anti-freeze tastes sweet, red mouthwash looks like fruit punch, etc.
 Children imitate the behavior of adults and frequently mimic what they see their parents or grandparents do, such as taking medication, drinking colored liquids, cleaning house, and spraying chemicals.

Although the warning’s author argues for the outright ban of hand sanitizer from any home where small children reside, it needs be kept in mind that a 2005 study of 292 families by Children’s Hospital Boston (in which one-half of the subjects got hand sanitizers, while the other half received literature advising them to wash their hands frequently) found that those who used hand sanitizer gels experienced a 59% reduction in gastrointestinal illnesses, and that increased use of sanitizers corresponded with a decreased spread of contagions (including those resulting in respiratory illnesses).",mixture

6180.0,"A newspaper clipping from 1918 documents a ""public notice"" from the city of Kelowna, British Columbia, announcing that schools, movie theaters, and other public places would be closed to prevent the spread of ""Spanish Influenza.","Did Cities Close Schools, Businesses During the 1918 Pandemic?
The year 2020 was not the first time public places were ordered closed to prevent the spread of a disease.
As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Browse our coronavirus fact checks here. Tell us about any questionable or concerning rumors and “advice” you encounter here.

In March 2020, as cities around the world announced “shelter-in-place” or “self-quarantine” orders in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19, social media users started to circulate an image that supposedly showed a newspaper clipping from 1918 with a similar announcement in the town of Kelowna, British Columbia:

The clipping reads:
Public Notice.
Notice is hearby given that, in order to prevent the spread of Spanish Influenza, all Schools, public and private, Churches, Theaters, Moving Picture Halls, Pool Rooms and other places of amusement, and Lodge meetings, are to be closed until further notice.
All public gatherings consisting of 10 or more are prohibited.
D. W. Sutherland, Mayor.
Kelowna, B.C., 19 October 1918.
This is a genuine newspaper clipping that was published in the Kelowna Record in 1918 as this Canadian town, as well as the rest of the world, fought to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, commonly and misleadingly called the “Spanish Flu.” The clipping was archived by the University of British Columbia and can be viewed here.
Kelowna, of course, was not the only city to issue such an order. We searched the archives of Newspapers.com and found several similar announcements in cities across the United States.
On Oct. 10, 1918, for instance, Des Moines, Iowa, Mayor Thomas P. Fairweather announced that “in order to prevent the spread of Spanish Influenza and to protect the public health and safety,” he was directing “all public places of amusement, including theaters, moving pictures houses, dance halls and public dancing places, pool and billiard halls, skating rinks, outdoor athletic events, all public congregating places subject to unusual congestion, be closed.”

Mobile, Alabama, took these closures one step further. In addition to closing restaurants and businesses, Mobile also asked people to refrain from kissing:
 Tue, Oct 8, 1918 – 10 · Knoxville Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee) · Newspapers.com
In 1918, just like today, individual cities and states made the decision to close schools, businesses, and public gathering places. According to a recent study from the Journal of the American Society of Cytopathology, cities that implemented strict social guidelines during the early days of the 1918 pandemic saw lower transmission rates and reduced total mortalities.
During the 1918-19 H1N1 “Spanish” influenza pandemic, which infected a fifth to a third of the world population, and during which 50 million people have died worldwide, including an estimated 675,000 Americans, the United States has adopted a range of nonpharmaceutical (public health) interventions. These measures, which were similar to those currently adopted, included closure of schools and churches, banning of mass gatherings, mandated mask wearing, case isolation, and disinfection/hygiene measures. However, these measures were not implemented at the same time or for the same duration in different cities, nor were they uniformly followed. A recent analysis concluded that in some cities (San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City), where the measures were implemented early, they reduced transmission rates by up to 30–50%. Cities that implemented such measures earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality, and had lower peak mortality rates and lower total mortality. The duration that these “social distancing” measures were kept in place correlated with a reduced total mortality burden. Although we still have no known effective therapy or vaccine prevention for this coronavirus, and the world is a quite different place than it was 100 years ago, the efficacy of the measures instituted during the 1918-19 pandemic gives us hope that the current measures will also limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
National Geographic saw a similar pattern when it looked at the total deaths during the 1918 pandemic in various cities in the U.S. Philadelphia, for instance, held a large parade a few days after its first H1N1 death and saw a major spike in deaths. St. Louis, on the other hand, implemented social-distancing measures early on and managed to delay its mortality peak: 
PHILADELPHIA DETECTED ITS first case of a deadly, fast-spreading strain of influenza on September 17, 1918. The next day, in an attempt to halt the virus’ spread, city officials launched a campaign against coughing, spitting, and sneezing in public. Yet 10 days later — despite the prospect of an epidemic at its doorstep — the city hosted a parade that 200,000 people attended …
… Shortly after health measures were put in place in Philadelphia, a case popped up in St. Louis. Two days later, the city shut down most public gatherings and quarantined victims in their homes. The cases slowed. By the end of the pandemic, between 50 and 100 million people were dead worldwide, including more than 500,000 Americans — but the death rate in St. Louis was less than half of the rate in Philadelphia. The deaths due to the virus were estimated to be about 385 people per 100,000 in St Louis, compared to 807 per 100,000 in Philadelphia during the first six months — the deadliest period — of the pandemic.
In short, the 1918 newspaper clipping from Kelowna, British Columbia, that announced the closures of schools, businesses, and other public places during the H1N1 pandemic is real, but not unique. Similar announcements were made in a variety of cities in an attempt to slow the spread of the Spanish flu.",TRUE

On March 29, 2020, Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney to U.S. President Donald Trump, tweeted about a treatment from family practitioner Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who has claimed to have treated 669 COVID-19 coronavirus patients with a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc:

A more detailed explainer of the potential role of anti-malarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, with or without antibiotics, can be found here. Zelenko’s claims, however, rest solely on taking him at his word: He has published no data, described no study design, and reported no analysis.
In an open letter to Trump dated March 23, 2020, and published online in various locations, Zelenko provided his first batch of assertions without providing evidence to support his treatment regime:
I developed the following treatment protocol in the pre-hospital setting and have seen only positive results. […]
The rationale for my treatment plan is as follows. […] We know that hydroxychloroquine helps Zinc enter the cell. We know that Zinc slows viral replication within the cell. Regarding the use of azithromycin, I postulate it prevents secondary bacterial infections. These three drugs are well known and usually well tolerated, hence the risk to the patient is low.
Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.
In sum, my urgent recommendation is to initiate treatment in the outpatient setting as soon as possible in accordance with the above. Based on my direct experience, it prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), prevents the need for hospitalization and saves lives.
As has been noted elsewhere, combining hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can cause serious problems for people with certain heart conditions. Though zinc appears to be an important factor in several immune functions, a potential mechanism for how it might work against viral infections is not well-understood.
In an interview with Forward, Zelenko “acknowledged that his regimen was new and untested, and that it was too soon to assess its long-term effectiveness.” He instead argued that “the risks of waiting to verify its efficacy” were greater. This is an assertion with which public health officials largely disagree.
Regardless, making an assertion in a blog post or in a YouTube interview that neither describes the study design nor provides the actual data used to reach a conclusion about efficacy cannot, in any way, be critically evaluated. As such, this claim is rated “Unproven.”",FALSE

On April 3, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new recommendation to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease: People should wear cloth or fabric face masks when they go grocery shopping, visit pharmacies, or do other essential errands. Made from T-shirts or bandanas, these face coverings are an at-home alternative to surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which the CDC recommended only for healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic.
The recommendation — which the CDC posted in a statement on its website alongside a 45-second video of U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams demonstrating how to make one of the cloth masks — spurred a wave of do-it-yourself guides online. 
But this raised a new dilemma among crafty Americans making their own masks: How should people clean the masks in order to safely reuse them? Making a new face guard for each trip outside could prove tedious.
Cue the advice of Facebook: “Those that use a fabric mask – after wearing place in ziplock bag and microwave 2-3 minutes to sanitize. Do this after each wear,” says a post that users have shared more than 7,200 times. Another post with similar advice has about five times that amount of shares.
People contacted Snopes seeking clarity.
According to an April 9 instructional guide by the CDC, people who go outside wearing fabric or cloth masks should clean them regularly, the frequency of which depends on how often the face coverings are used. When asked by Snopes if microwaving cloth masks will sanitize them, a CDC spokesperson responded via email with a bulleted list of what cloth face coverings should do, including “fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face” and “be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.” The latter bullet point was highlighted yellow in the email.
In other words, the CDC has not explicitly forbidden the public from microwaving the face coverings nor weighed in on the effectiveness of the method. But it has made this recommendation, including in its April 9 guide: “A washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering.”
Meanwhile, Greeneville/Greene County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security on Facebook warned against microwaving face masks, writing on Facebook:
There are a couple of problems with this:
1. The microwave will set flame and/or burn certain materials.
2. If your mask has metal in it, refer to issue number 1, as well as, possibly killing your microwave.
Please do NOT microwave your hand made masks.
Washing in warm water and Antibacterial Soap and a small amount of bleach will disinfect your masks of any germs. Yes this includes COVID-19.
“DO NOT place any face mask in the microwave for any amount of time,” the Colorado River Fire Rescue department also said on Facebook. “There is no evidence that microwaving a face mask will sanitize it properly.”
Proof of people’s failed attempts at the microwave idea are available via social media, too. People have shared stories of kitchen fires starting in their microwave and photos of charred fabric masks. “I tried it,” one Facebook user wrote. “Please don’t try it. It smells awful.”",FALSE

In April 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media holding that seven children in Senegal had died after being administered a COVID-19 coronavirus disease vaccine.

There is no truth to this rumor. Seven children did not die in Senegal in April 2020 after they were administered a vaccine for COVID-19.  A spokeswoman for Senegal’s health ministry told the AFP news site that these claims were “fake news.”
The spokesperson said:
“There is no vaccine … We have medical experts at the Institut Pasteur (a medical research institute, editor’s note) in Dakar working to create and certify a vaccine according to procedure. They will be completely transparent about their findings.”
This rumor was largely based on a piece of footage from March that showed a somewhat chaotic scene in Senegal. One version of the video that was widely circulated on social media contained narration from a man speaking in French.
In that video, the narrator says: “There is a big scandal in Senegal. There is a guy who came into a house to get kids vaccinated for coronavirus. He vaccinated seven children who died on the spot.”
However, this is not the original audio that accompanied this footage. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 found a version of the video in Wolof, the most common language in Senegal, and found that while the Wolof narration also mentioned a COVID-19 vaccine, the claim about seven dead children was absent.
In the Wolof version, the narrator says:
“He’s a guy who came to the neighborhood today with injections supposedly against the coronavirus. He entered the house of the Mbodji family. He said he is there to administer vaccines. The family members told him that this is not true. He fled to go to the neighborhood chief. He was finally neutralized right here with the neighborhood chief. We are currently there and the gendarmerie is there too. Everyone is there for that ”.
This version of events matches up with news stories from local Senegal publications. On March 26, the website Senego reported that two people were arrested in the country after they claimed to have a vaccine for COVID-19.
The AFP confirmed with local police that a man (not two men) was briefly arrested. However, this incident appears to have been the result of a misunderstanding. The man was apparently selling cosmetics door-to-door, but he was also wearing a health ministry T-shirt. When the word “coronavirus” was mentioned, people started to panic, thinking that he was there to forcibly administer vaccines.
A spokeswoman for the Senegal health ministry told the AFP:
“He never wanted to vaccinate people. He was passing by a house, and the resident’s aunt started causing panic when she heard the word ‘coronavirus’. A crowd of people gathered outside, thinking this man wanted to vaccinate people by force.”
A spokesperson for the armed forces ministry said that no medical equipment was found at the scene, adding:
“There was just one man who was a Senegalese national selling cosmetics door to door … During the discussion, a member of the family asked him if he had any vaccines. He jokingly replied that he did. The aunt rounded up the whole neighbourhood. Officers attended and found only cosmetic products in the man’s bag. The drama was caused by the fact he was wearing a health ministry t-shirt.”
France 24 managed to contact the woman living in the house where this fiasco took place. Alassane Mbodji told the news outlet that “everything that is said on social networks is false. No one died of any vaccine. Our children are healthy.”
Mbodji explained:
About two weeks ago, a man came home around noon. He introduced himself as an agent of the Ministry of Health who came to raise awareness about the threat of coronavirus and the precautions to be taken to avoid it, such as regular hand washing.
He had worn a t-shirt flanked by a logo from the Department of Health. But in the discussions, we quickly realized that he was not an agent of the Ministry of Health. He did not have a badge. He had cosmetic products for sale in his bag.
Outside people are prohibited from entering homes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But this person pretended to be a public agent to be able to sell his articles. So we sent him back to the neighborhood chief. And from there, the gendarmerie took him.
To sum up: The claim that seven children died after being administered a vaccine for COVID-19 is false. This rumor is largely based on video showing a somewhat chaotic scene in Senegal involving a door-to-door salesman, a health ministry T-shirt, and growing concern about the COVID-19 pandemic.",FALSE

The scientist was one of the first people in the U.K. to be administered a trial vaccine for the coronavirus disease.
On April 23, 2020, Elisa Granato became one of the first people to take part in a trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine at Oxford University. The following day, false reports started to circulate on social media that claimed she had died from the vaccination. 
One such article published to a website called News NT claimed:
Elisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic, has died.
She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated.
This is not a genuine news article. While Granato truly took part in a vaccine trial for COVID-19, she has not died. Her tweets are protected, but she did update her profile to explain that she is “100% alive”:

The University of Oxford News Office confirmed to Reuters that Granato was “alive and well,” while the U.K.’s Department of Health and Social Care called the reports of Granato’s death “completely untrue” on Twitter:

BBC News reporter Fergus Walsh also confirmed that Granato was alive, writing on Twitter: “Fake news has been circulating on social media that the first volunteer in the Oxford vaccine trial has died. This is not true! I spent several minutes this morning chatting with Elisa Granato via Skype. She is very much alive and told me she is feeling ‘absolutely fine.'”
Ferguson shared a video of his call with Granato on April 26, the day after she supposedly died from the vaccine:

Oxford University also posted an update on its page dedicated to the COVID-19 vaccine trial, explaining that “false reports about the progress of the trial” had been circulating on social media. The university cautioned readers this likely would not be the last time a false rumor would circulate about the vaccine trial and urged people to get updates about the trial directly from the source:
The university wrote:
We are aware there have been and will be rumours and false reports about the progress of the trial. We urge people not to give these any credibility and not to circulate them. We will not be offering a running commentary about the trial but all official updates will appear on this site.

Wearing a face covering in public during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic is sound advice (and in some circumstances a legal requirement) that could help slow the spread of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But just how effective are these masks? In April 2020, many social media users encountered a simple chart that supposedly showed how effective face masks could be at preventing coronavirus infections:

We’re skeptical about the accuracy of this chart. It doesn’t appear to have originated with a reputable source; this meme does not specify the type of mask (homemade cloth mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask) used in the chart; and we were unable to find any studies that confirm these specific percentages. 
We’ve seen this chart posted by a variety of accounts on several different platforms but have yet to come across any information about who created it. While we’re not certain if this chart was created by an anonymous social media user (social media has been a hotbed of bad medical information during the COVID-19 pandemic) or from a reputable organization, the evidence indicates that it came from the former. 
We were not, for instance, able to find this chart on the CDC website. The CDC even has a page dedicated to “Respiratory Protection Infographics,” but the above-displayed chart is not included on that page. This chart is also absent from the CDC’s page that recommends the use of cloth face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The CDC confirmed to us that it did not create this chart and that the agency could not confirm the accuracy of these statistics. At the moment, a spokesperson told us, there is not enough data to “quantify risk reduction from the use of masks.”
The punctuation in this chart may provide a clue about its origins. While the percent sign is commonly placed after the number in English and many other languages, this symbol comes before the number in Turkish. As luck would have it, we found a variation of this chart in Turkish that has been circulating on Facebook since April 10:

In addition to this chart’s unknown origins, another reason to be skeptical of these numbers is that this social media post does not identify the type of mask being used. Is this chart about homemade cloth masks? Surgical masks? Or the N95 respirator mask? These masks all provide different levels of protection against the spread of disease, with the N95 being the most effective. 
The FDA explains the differences:
CDC Recommends Cloth Face Coverings for Use by the General Public: The CDC recommends that members of the public use simple cloth face coverings when in a public setting to slow the spread of the virus, since this will help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
Surgical Masks: … If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.
While a surgical mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, a face mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and your face.
N95 Respirators: An N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles.
The ‘N95’ designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.
The CDC elaborated on the purpose of wearing homemade cloth masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC writes that since many people with coronavirus may be “asymptomatic,” meaning that they don’t show any symptoms, wearing a cloth mask can prevent these contagious individuals from unknowingly spreading the disease:
CDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States. We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.
It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus. CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
When we reached out to the CDC, a spokesperson reiterated this point, saying that wearing a mask is a good way of “strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.”
A spokesperson for the CDC told us:
“As we study the virus, CDC has learned that a good proportion of individuals who have COVID-19 spread virus before they become symptomatic and a few people never have symptoms at all but are still infected and infectious. That means, that people who are not coughing or sneezing can be a source of infection for others. Something simple like speaking is enough to generate aerosols that can spread the infection to other people.
A simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk. The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment. Therefore, “my mask protects you, and your mask protects me!” It’s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.
The numbers provided in the above-displayed viral social media post are also suspiciously specific. While there have been studies regarding the efficacy of masks during COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are still learning about how this disease spreads and how to best prevent it. For instance, Live Science noted that two recent studies regarding the efficacy of face masks during this pandemic came to slightly different conclusions. 
Live Science writes:
For the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks — particularly the homemade fabric masks that the CDC recommends for the public — can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
Researchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.
The bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren’t the most important protection against the coronavirus.
Some experts have also expressed concern that widespread use of homemade cloth masks give people a false sense of security. The White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said that social distancing is still the most important preventative measure a person can take during this pandemic:
“The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands,” she said. “And we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask. Because if they’re touching things — remember your eyes are not in the mask — so if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes you’re exposing yourself in the same way.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) reiterated this point. WHO said in a statement that “masks alone cannot stop the pandemic:” 
“Masks alone cannot stop the pandemic. Countries must continue to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact. Mask or no mask, there are proven things all of us can do to protect ourselves and others – keep your distance, clean your hands, cough or sneeze into your elbow, and avoid touching your face.”",mostly-false

In spring 2020, Facebook users circulated a post with a photograph of a small bottle labeled “canine coronavirus vaccine,” suggesting that the vaccine should have been available to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in humans.

“Now this was 2001 tell me why 19 years later they say there is no vaccine,” reads part of the original post, which appears to have been deleted or removed from public viewing.
Sharing that picture and its caption, another user posted: “Canine vaccine for dogs and not humans? … STAY WOKE PEOPLE!!”
But as of May 4, no vaccine currently exists for SARS-CoV-2, which is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has killed hundreds of thousands of people globally, and prompted government-imposed lockdowns in 2020. And a vaccine to fight coronaviruses that have infected dogs won’t work on COVID-19 in humans.
The confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the word “coronavirus,” which actually refers to a family of hundreds of viruses, not just one type of sickness. Politicians and journalists frequently — and misleadingly — used the term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the novel coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
But the reality is this: Most of us will catch at least one type of coronavirus in our lifetime and suffer cold-like symptoms while others may suffer more severe and sometimes fatal infections, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Listing all of the types of coronaviruses that can cause disease in humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states:
Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.
Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. [There are] seven coronaviruses that can infect people […].
One of the seven is SARS-CoV-2 — the strain for which epidemiologists are scrambling to create a vaccine to end the 2019-2020 global health crisis.
Meanwhile, some types of coronaviruses cause illness in animals, including cattle, camels, cats, and dogs. Of that type, some remain exclusively in the animal world, while others — on rare occasions — mutate in such a way that allows them to infect humans, according to the CDC. That was the case with the COVID-19 outbreak, though scientists have yet to pinpoint the exact source of the virus as of this writing.
The popular Facebook photo does show a real vaccine used to help dogs fight a specific strain of coronavirus unique to that species. The type of shot, however, is not effective in humans and will not help scientists fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The vaccine, called Nobivac Canine 1-Cv, is “designed to enhance the immune response and offer protection against canine coronavirus,” according to Merck Animal Health, which is the manufacturer of the vaccine. The product is “approved for the vaccination of healthy dogs as an aid in the prevention of disease caused by canine coronavirus infection,” which can cause intestinal and respiratory sickness.
The manufacturer’s website also states canine coronaviruses “are not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection” — the same web page includes an image of a product that looks similar to the one featured in the viral Facebook post.
Although government officials and the news media often referred to the virus at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic as simply “coronavirus” in the early days of the outbreak, scientists have urged the use of a more accurate name. According to the World Health Organization, the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes is referred to as COVID-19. 
In conclusion, the word “coronavirus” refers to a group of viruses, and any vaccine that has been effective fighting the spread of one particular strain of the virus family — including canine coronavirus, MERS, or SARS — is not necessarily going to provide immunity against other variations in this group. As of May 4, 2020 no vaccine exists for SARS-CoV-2. And for these reasons, we rate this claim “False.”",FALSE

Prolonged usage of certain masks can cause some health concerns.
During the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in the spring of 2020, questions arose about protective measures. Social media users shared related images, and in one case, a newspaper column claimed that continual or prolonged use of face masks resulted in breathing too much of one’s own exhaled carbon dioxide, which can lead to health concerns. 
“Dr. Dennis A Castro B” wrote in the Nigerian newspaper Vanguard, for instance, that prolonged use of face masks causes hypoxia: 
Breathing over and over exhaled air turns into carbon dioxide, which is why we feel dizzy.
This intoxicates the user and much more when he must move, carry out displacement actions. It causes discomfort, loss of reflexes and conscious thought. It generates great fatigue. In addition, oxygen deficiency causes glucose breakdown and endangered lactic acid rise.
The post does not specify what kinds of masks cause these issues (though the article image does show N95 respirator masks), nor does it indicate whether this affects people with respiratory conditions more. It should be noted that hypoxia is a condition in which the tissues of the body are starved of oxygen. 
Another post on Facebook argued that prolonged mask usage caused hypercapnia, a condition arising from too much carbon dioxide in the blood. 
Image via Facebook.
Symptoms of hypercapnia include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headaches, feeling disoriented, flushing of the skin, and shortness of breath. Severe symptoms include a loss of consciousness, coma, hyperventilation, twitching muscles, and seizures, among others. Preexisting respiratory illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can cause both hypercapnia and hypoxia. 
But research articles and experts suggest that such extreme symptoms are unlikely to occur in most people. Dr. Abrar Ahmad Chughtai, an epidemiologist and lecturer at the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at University of New South Wales Australia, says the risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia are unlikely to take place with cloth and surgical masks, because they are not tight-fitting: 
Some people with pre-existing respiratory illnesses (like asthma, COPD), may face breathing difficulty with use of certain types of tight fitted masks, called respirators. [There is] less chance of hypoxia as they may discontinue using masks in that case. Risk is very low with cloth and surgical masks as they are not tight around [the] face.
He also argued that in the case of prolonged usage of any of these masks, “Dizziness [was] less likely, but fatigue may occur.”
The N95 respirator is an example of personal protective equipment (PPE) usually worn by health workers to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that the general public use these masks because health workers and other medical first responders need them more. 
A team of Stanford engineers is developing an N95 face mask to counteract the side effects of oxygen deficiency. In an interview, John Xu, a mechanical engineer behind the effort, said:
N95 masks are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. That’s significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness. If you wear a mask long enough, it can damage the lungs. For a patient in respiratory distress, it can even be life threatening.
And their focus is on getting these masks to healthcare workers first.
We are targeting this to anyone who has to wear a mask for the long term, first responders, doctors, nurses and even patients who don’t want to infect others. In the near term, we hope to get these into healthcare workers as soon as possible.
The general public is unlikely to wear masks for a prolonged period other than for short stints outside of homes, according to Reuters. A CDC representative spoke to Reuters: 
The CO2 will slowly build up in the mask over time. However, the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia.
The CDC recommends that the general public wear cloth masks, leaving N95 respirators and surgical masks to healthcare workers. They also offer exceptions for who should be wearing them:
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
With these recommendations comes the additional guidance that face masks should not be a substitute for social distancing. 
The Vanguard piece also says it is dangerous to use masks in cars:
Some people drive their car with the mask on, that is very dangerous, because, the stale air can make the driver lose consciousness.
Chughtai said he believed such danger was “less likely,” and that running while wearing such a mask also was “unlikely” to cause breathing issues, unless the runner had a pre-existing respiratory illness.
In all, little research has been done on the impact of masks on wearers, according to Chughtai. In some studies, participants noted breathing difficulties, but not hypoxia. 
Ultimately, the impact of a mask on its wearer depends on the wearer’s health, any pre-existing respiratory illnesses, the type of mask, and the length of time the person wears it. In most instances, the effects of prolonged cloth mask usage are small. Masks, like most short-term measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, should be worn only if the wearer has to be in close proximity to others, and be used in addition to necessary measures like social distancing, and more. As such, we rate this claim about the dangers of masks as “Mostly false.”",mostly-false

In April 2020, as major stores such as Costco started requiring customers to wear masks in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a message started to circulate on social media that appeared to encourage Americans to lie about having medical conditions in order to exploit a “mask loophole.”
The message generally read:
✨MASK LOOPHOLE✨
Store clerk at the door:
“Excuse me, but do you have a mask?
I can’t let you in without one”. 😬
Me: “No I’m sorry, I have a medical condition that prohibits the use of anything that could restrict the flow of oxygen to my lungs or brain”. 😶
Their answer 90% of the time:
“Oh, okay, sounds good to me, 🤷🏻‍♀️
Go ahead, have a great day”
Their answer 10% of the time:
“What kind of medical condition is THAT”?
Gentle Answer: “According to HIPAA regulations, you’re not allowed to ask me that. Please don’t discriminate against those who can not wear masks, we need our essentials too.
I’ll be in and out”
As long as you’re polite and non aggressive, this has not failed me yet. # staaayfreeeee 🙌🏼
These “mask loophole” posts sometimes opened with the declaration “Don’t want to wear a mask? Try this!” and ended with “What have you got to lose?” They were frequently accompanied by one of two images supposedly showing flyers issued from the U.S. Department of Justice that could be presented to stores to explain that these people were “exempt” from these rules:

However, these flyers were not issued, endorsed, or distributed by the Department of Justice, and the advice relayed in the “mask loophole” flyer is both legally and morally questionable. 
The social media post above essentially argues that able-bodied people can lie about having a medical condition in order to avoid wearing a mask in a store that requires customers to wear them. If the store presses them on the issue, they can claim that the store would be violating the federal American Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by asking them about their medical conditions.
This social media post doesn’t relay a “mask loophole” so much as it encourages people to exploit a law designed to provide protections to disabled people. 
We reached out to several regional ADA centers for more information about the flyers. While their answers varied in length and content, they all hit on one major theme: Americans without disabilities are not protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act: 
New England ADA Center: The ADA protects the privacy of people who have disabilities. People who lie about a medical condition and don’t have one, do not have rights under the ADA.
We are not in favor of people lying in order to get the modifications of policies and procedures that are the legitimate right of people with disabilities for whom wearing a face mask would be detrimental to their medical conditions.
 Great Lakes ADA Center: “Individuals without disabilities do not have protected rights in terms of the conditions set forth by a business, etc. in order to come into their establishment but a person with a disability does have rights (ADA plus many state civil rights laws) and thus, business entities must understand these issues and look at what they can do, how they can do it and creative ways of addressing any concerns that they have.”
Northeast ADA Center: The ADA protects individuals with disabilities. As with many things in our society, there are people that attempt to take advantage of our system. There are typically remedies for this in criminal and civil law.
A spokesperson for the Justice Department told us the department did not issue the flyers. All of the ADA centers we contacted also told us that they were unfamiliar with the flyers. 
The scenario depicted in this social media post (a citizen refusing to wear a mask at a grocery store) is also unrelated to HIPAA. (It’s worth noting that one of these viral flyers misspelled this acronym “HIPPA”). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed in 1996 with the aim of protecting private medical records. HIPAA restricts hospitals and health care providers from sharing protected information and gives patients better access to their own records. This law has little to do with customers at a grocery store.
Kathy Gips, the director of training at the New England ADA Center, told us:
HIPAA only applies to three types of covered entities: health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers. It restricts their ability to share protected health information. It also gives patients access to their own medical records. It has nothing to do with customers or stores or employment or anything else.
HIPAA does not apply to individuals (in this case, store clerks) asking a customer to wear a mask. It applies to the release of medical records from health personnel. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reiterates this point on its website, explaining that HIPAA regulations apply only to “covered entities,” including health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses. HHS writes:
The Privacy Rule, as well as all the Administrative Simplification rules, apply to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and to any health care provider who transmits health information in electronic form in connection with transactions for which the Secretary of HHS has adopted standards under HIPAA (the “covered entities”). 
The HHS website also notes that HIPAA does not apply to other entities, such as law enforcement, employers, and schools. 
While this social media post appeared to be widely circulated by able-bodied people seeking to exploit a “mask loophole,” the ADA does truly protect individuals who cannot wear a mask due to medical conditions from being discriminated against. This means that stores that implement mask requirements have to find ways to accommodate individuals who cannot wear a mask.
Gips explained: 
Title III of the ADA requires businesses to make reasonable modifications of policies, practices and procedures … The store should work with the person to maintain 6 ft social distancing, and if that’s not possible to consider accommodations such as shopping for the person and providing curbside service or home delivery.
So what about Costco? 
These flyers were widely circulated in the wake of Costco’s announcement that it would be temporarily requiring customers to wear masks while shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic. While these social media posts claimed that showing one of these flyers to a Costco employee would force them store to adhere to the ADA’s anti-discrimination guidelines, Costco was already operating with this in mind. In fact, when Costco announced the mask requirement it noted that this new policy did “not apply to children under the age of 2 or to individuals who are unable to wear a face covering due to a medical condition.”",mostly-false

In the winter of 1968, the H3N2 virus, also referred to as the “Hong Kong flu,” spread widely in the United States. Over the next 18 months, the pandemic killed an estimated 100,000 people in the U.S. and 1 million worldwide, yet daily life, more or less, proceeded as if it were business as usual. There were no statewide lockdowns or mandatory mask requirements, and large public events, such as the Woodstock music festival, took place as scheduled. 
So what changed? Why did the U.S. operate under one set of guidelines during a pandemic in the 1960s only to implement much stricter rules during a pandemic in 2020? 
That’s the thrust of an article published by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) on May 1, 2020, under the headline “Woodstock Occurred in the Middle of a Pandemic.” Although the headline of this article is factually accurate (Woodstock took place in August 1969), the argument that government officials should be approaching all future pandemics the same way they did during the 1960s is flawed for several reasons. 
Let’s start with the basics.
Not All Pandemics Are Created Equal
The world has seen a number of plagues and pandemics in its history, from the bubonic plague in the 1300s, which killed an estimated 200 million people, to smallpox, which killed an estimated 300 million people throughout the 20th century. Although these diseases may all have the same end result (sickness and death), they also vary in variety of ways, such as their lethality and incubation periods.
Medicine, too, improves, and some diseases are more quickly met with treatments and vaccines than others. The bubonic plague, for example, still exists but can be easily treated with antibiotics. 
Every pandemic has unique challenges, yet the premise of the AIER article is based largely on the idea that the pandemic in the 1960s and the pandemic today involved two practically interchangeable diseases. After noting that the population in the U.S. was smaller in the 1960s (200 million compared to 330 million), the article states that “in terms of lethality, [H3N2] was as deadly and scary as COVID-19 if not more so.” But that really isn’t the case. 
While the 1968 flu was classified as a pandemic, this outbreak wasn’t as deadly as previous pandemics, such as the 1918 flu. 
Dr. David Morens, a senior scientific adviser at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described the 1968 pandemic as “wimpy” compared to previous pandemics and noted that the total number of deaths wasn’t much different than the amount of deaths seen during an average flu season.
Morens told us:
The number of deaths caused by that pandemic in the first two years, 1968 and 1969, weren’t much higher than the average seasonal flu. So, it really was kind of a pandemic that was such a wimpy pandemic it didn’t make much of a blip on the radar screen. 
A 2008 study published in the American Journal of Public Health that examined seasonal flu trends supports Morens’ assertion. This study found that the 1957 pandemic and the 1968 pandemic did “not stand out as exceptional outliers, nor were these pandemics visually discernible from non-pandemics in seasonal or monthly influenza mortality graphs.”

Seasonal Spread
While this flu analogy has been poorly used to describe COVID-19, it is an apt description for the H3N2 virus which, quite literally, continues to circulate as a variety of the seasonal flu. 
The H3N2 virus followed a seasonal flu pattern after its initial outbreak in 1968. Generally speaking, this means that the disease peaks during the winter months before waning in the summer. Here’s a chart from a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases showing the seasonal spread of H3N2. We added a red “X” to this chart to show when Woodstock occurred:Woodstock took place in the summer of 1969 when there were practically no reported cases of H3N2 in the U.S. The majority of U.S. deaths happened several months prior to this festival, and the second wave of this pandemic didn’t hit until a few months after. 
COVID-19 is not expected to follow a similar seasonal pattern. Although researchers are not entirely sure how the changing seasons will impact the spread of COVID-19, evidence exists that COVID-19 can spread in warmer climates.  
Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote:
The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.
Treatments and Immunity
The H3N2 virus proved to be less deadly than previous pandemics in part because it emerged  approximately 10 years after the world dealt with a similar virus, H2N2, also called the “Asian flu.” As these two diseases both contained the N2 neuraminidase, populations that survived H2N2 had already built up immunity to the H3N2 virus. 
Morens told us: “In 1968, the US population had partial immunity. Because the 1968 virus was H3N2 and the 1957 virus was H2N2 so the whole population had a degree of protection related to the N2 neuraminidase. So the brakes were on this pandemic before it even appeared and we knew that early on.”
A vaccine for this disease was also quickly developed (although it was not widely available) just a few months after the initial outbreak. On the other hand, there are no “specific treatments for COVID-19” and a vaccine is still months, if not years, away as of this writing. 
Comparable Death Tolls? 
One of the arguments made in the AIER article is that the 1968 pandemic resulted in the deaths of 100,000 people, yet daily life, more or less, proceeded as normal. By comparison, the author argues, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed fewer people (as of this writing), yet has resulted in a major disruption of American life. When we take a closer look at these figures, however, we see that they aren’t truly comparable. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately 100,000 people died in the U.S. during the H3N2 pandemic, with the majority of deaths occurring during the first wave in 1968. This figure accounts for pandemic-related deaths over the span of approximately 18 months. Comparatively speaking, COVID-19 has so far resulted in more than 80,000 deaths over an approximate 4-month span.
Morens told us: “It’s not comparable. It’s not comparable in a lot of ways but particularly in its mortality. It’s also not comparable in the effects of what would happen if you just let it go.”
Impact of Social Distancing
Of course, when we compare the death tolls from the 1968 pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, we also have to factor in the impact of social distancing and shelter-in place policies. While the 1968 pandemic saw some social distancing measures (more on that below), these guidelines were nowhere near as stringent as the policies put in place today. Generally speaking, H3N2 was allowed to spread unabated.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, on the other hand, the U.S. economy was basically shut down to slow the spread of the disease. But even with these extreme measures in place, COVID-19 resulted in more than 80,000 deaths during its first few months. If these social distancing measures were not put in place (i.e., if Woodstock-like festivals were allowed to go on as planned), it’s reasonable to assume that the death toll would be much higher. 
In fact, in April 2020, after some states started to relax their shelter-in place guidelines and allowed businesses to reopen, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington revised its death toll estimate for the beginning of August from 60,000 to 135,000:
The institute wrote that the revisions reflected “rising mobility in most U.S. states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus.”
Were Social Distancing Measures Implemented in 1968?
While the social-distancing measures implemented in 1968 were a far cry from the policies enacted 2020, it’s not accurate to say that “nothing closed” and “schools stayed open,” as the AIER article stated. We found several newspaper clippings from 1968 noting that schools, businesses, and even political ceremonies were impacted by H3N2: 
 Fri, Dec. 13, 1968 – 9 · The Post-Crescent (Appleton, Wisconsin) · Newspapers.com
A Getty Images photograph from December 1968 shows a nurse at Cleveland’s Grace Hospital in front of a sign announcing the temporary restriction of all visitors during the pandemic:
Nurse Nadyne Weber stands by her notice severely restricting visiting hours at Cleveland’s Grace Hospital due to a flu outbreak.
A Poor Comparison
The argument that today’s shelter-in place rules are unnecessary because similar rules were not implemented in the 1960s is based on a faulty comparison between two vastly different pandemics. On one hand, you have a disease that killed approximately 100,000 people over the span of 18 months during which little to no social distancing rules were implemented to stop it. On the other, you have a disease that has killed more than 80,000 people over the span of just a few months in spite of extreme self-quarantine laws that were implemented around the country. 
So what if we treated COVID-19 the same way we treated H3N2 in 1968? In other words, what if we let another Woodstock go on in 2020? 
Morens told us that if we just let things go the way we did in the Woodstock era and waited until the population reached herd immunity, the U.S. would see more than 1 million deaths from COVID-19. 
Morens said: “COVID-19 is far more deadly than the 1968 pandemic virus … We have about 5% of herd immunity right now in the nation. By the time we get to 70%, think about that, that’s 14 times as many cases as we have now. And if you project that onto 80,000 deaths, you can see [if we just] let things go, as we did in the Woodstock era, we’d have more than 1 million deaths.”",mixture

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams made comments in February and March 2020 recommending people not wear masks to help protect against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and those comments began to recirculate online in April and May. As of April, though, Adams had changed his views in accordance with evolving recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and, to a lesser extent, from the World Health Organization (WHO). 
On May 7, one Facebook post from Ohio State Rep. Nino Vitale’s Facebook account shared a Newsmax article that included Adams’ past comments. That post was re-shared  more than 700 times, along with the hashtags #EndMedicalDictatorship #FreedomAndLiberty:

On Feb. 29, 2020, Adams tweeted: 

Then in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on March 2 he said:
One of the things [the general public] shouldn’t be doing is going out and buying masks … It has not been proven to be effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus amongst the general public … Folks who don’t know how to wear them properly tend to touch their faces a lot, and actually can increase the spread of coronavirus. You can increase your risk of getting it by wearing a mask if you are not a healthcare provider.
In the same interview, he added that people should clean their hands frequently and stay at home when sick, while maintaining that he was “convinced” more people would die from the flu than from the coronavirus around the world. 
In another interview with “Fox & Friends,” on March 31, he added that “the data doesn’t show” that wearing masks in public will help people. He said:
What the World Health Organization [WHO] and the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear masks.
… On an individual level, there was a study in 2015 looking at medical students and medical students wearing surgical masks touch their face on average 23 times … We know a major way that you can get respiratory diseases like coronavirus is by touching a surface and then touching your face, so wearing a mask improperly can actually increase your risk of getting disease.
His recommendation corresponded with advice from the WHO in late March and early April, which stated that a person should only wear a mask if taking care of someone with COVID-19 (or a suspected case) or if exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, like coughing or sneezing. These masks are also only effective, according to the WHO, if combined with regular hand-washing and the avoidance of touching one’s face. 
Adams also said that wearing masks “can also give you a false sense of security.” He added, “You see many of these pictures with people out and about closer than 6 feet to each other, but still wearing a mask.” This corresponded with advice given by both the CDC and the WHO that masks should be worn in addition to other measures, like social distancing. 
One reason Adams initially discouraged the general public from wearing masks: saving critical supplies like N95 respirators for healthcare providers to use. He acknowledged advice on the use of “cotton masks” could eventually change, but the data did not yet support that. He echoed the point he made in his earlier tweet to Fox News on March 31: 
We still have PPE [Personal protective equipment] shortages across the country … The WHO mentioned this in their statement, so we want to make sure we are reserving PPE for the people who most need it. That’s how you are going to get the largest effect because if healthcare workers get sick, they can’t take care of you when you get sick.
In a White House press briefing on April 3, Adams changed his recommendation after he said he had received new guidance from the CDC. Echoing his earlier statements, he said:  
… I want people to understand that the CDC, the World Health Organization, my office, and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommended against the general public wearing masks, because based on the best evidence available at the time, it was not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract COVID-19.
We have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask, because if you’re coughing, if you have a fever, if you’re symptomatic, you could transmit disease to other people.
He followed this up with a clear recommendation that the general public should wear cloth masks outside of their homes in specific settings: 
… We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms. They’re what we call asymptomatic. And that even those who eventually become pre-symptomatic, meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future, can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity: for example, coughing, speaking, or sneezing, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms.
In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends and the [COVID-19] task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social-distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These include places like grocery stores and pharmacies. We especially recommend this in areas of significant community-based transmission. It is critical.
… The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by the current CDC guidance.
On April 3, he also appeared in a CDC video “How To Make Your Own Face Covering.”





We should note that the WHO’s interim guidelines remain ambivalent on the benefits of non-medical masks. The agency is still researching the effectiveness of such masks, even though the CDC now recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public. It is safe to assume that these recommendations will evolve once more data is available.  
In short, Adams’ changing statements have generally aligned with CDC guidelines. The more recent posts on social media omitted these changes, choosing instead to focus on statements he made a few months before. Adams again reaffirmed his view on masks via Twitter on May 13. 

Because his recommendation changed over time largely based on information from the CDC, we rate the truth of this claim “Mixture,” keeping in mind that Adams now recommends the general public use cloth masks along with maintaining other safety measures.",mixture
6469.0,Vegetarians are unaffected by COVID-19 because the virus is passed on through eating meat.,"Are Vegetarians Safe from COVID-19?
A claim alleges the World Health Organization found that vegetarians are unaffected by COVID-19 because the virus survives in animal fat.
As the COVID-19 coronavirus disease spread around the world, a false claim gained traction in India during March 2020 via social media, including messages in WhatsApp. A series of posts claimed that vegetarians were unaffected by the disease, attributing it to the World Health Organization (WHO).
On March 14, a post from the Facebook page I Support Indian Army (only radical Hindus join: please get 150 Hindus to join) was shared more than 600 times.
Image via Facebook.
The post says:
No vegetarian person in the world has been caught with corona: WHO report. Vegetarians rejoice, the demons will die.
But the WHO’s website does not include a report claiming that vegetarians are not susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
Another post forwarded to Snopes on WhatsApp attributes a quote to Dr. Gauden Galea, the WHO representative in China. In February, he’s shown saying in a Facebook video from a page called Lebanese Vegans:
As long as people eat meat, there is going to be some risk of infection. 
Image via WhatsApp.
Galea’s statement was in fact taken out of context. Indian news outlet The Logical Indian found a CNN report from January 2020 where he first made the statement after the origins of COVID-19 and its ability to spread from person-to-person was discovered. In an email exchange with The Logical Indian, he clarified: 
“The statement was part of a longer discussion about the continued global risk of zoonotic viruses and the potential for ‘spillover’ into human populations. The intent was not to endorse any particular diet nor to condemn any other, but to recognize that as long as people eat meat, there is a need to rear animals, to slaughter them, and to distribute and sell the products. This proximity of animals and humans thus generated will create the opportunity, indeed the certainty, of animal-human spillovers of infectious disease. It is important therefore that the trade-in all livestock, from farm to table, be regulated in a One-Health approach looking at animal and human health as one continuum, with all sectors involved acting in unison. This applies to an even greater extent to the illegal trade in wild animals for food where other laws and considerations, from law enforcement to quarantine and conservation, will also apply.”
Scientists suggest that COVID-19 likely came from bats first, possibly passing through an intermediary animal before infecting humans. The hypothesis that COVID-19 emerged at a live animal market at Wuhan is also inconclusive according to Dr. Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne’s Monash University. But the interactions of different species at wet markets with fresh meat, fish, and perishables has been identified as an issue, according to immunologist Dr. Michelle Baker. 
On Twitter, the following message was copied and retweeted hundreds of times, even though it appears to be from a parody account:  
Image via Twitter.
The post, from March 14, says: 
The whole world has become fans of sanatan culture. No vegetarian in the world has contracted coronavirus: WHO report. The entire world is now doing namaste… hawans and yajnas are being done… gaumutra (cow urine) and tulsi’s benefits are being understood… Gita and Ramayana are being read. Hail sanatan
This seemingly satirical post was shared by other non-parody accounts as well. The post suggests that the vegetarian lifestyle, particularly in the context of Hinduism, has protected people from contracting the virus. It also mentions rituals and belief systems specific to elements of Hinduism. 
Only 23-37% of Indians are estimated to be vegetarians, even though 80% of the population is Hindu. Hindus still make up a big proportion of meat eaters in the country, with an estimated one-third of upper-caste Hindus adhering to a vegetarian diet.  
It should also be noted that the above series of posts are proliferating on social media during a time of heightened anti-Muslim sentiment in India. Social media posts blaming the spread of the virus on the Muslim minority community are increasing, including the use of hashtags such as #CoronaJihad. In the past, Muslims and other minority groups have been targeted and faced violence in the past over accusations of slaughtering cows and eating beef. 
The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also released a post busting this myth, recommending that everyone should mainly eat thoroughly cooked food: 
Image via Facebook.
This aligns with the WHO’s recommendations on how to consume meat:
The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk, or animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.
The WHO also has guidelines for those who work in meat markets, particularly discouraging the slaughter and consumption of animals that were sick.
Slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians in charge of animal and food inspection in markets, market workers, and those handling live animals and animal products should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing. They should consider wearing protective gowns and gloves while professionally handling animals and fresh animal products. Equipment and working stations should be disinfected frequently, at least once a day. Protective clothing should be removed after work and washed daily. Workers should avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items. It is therefore recommended that protective clothes and items remain at the workplace for daily washing.
As a general recommendation, sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption; dead animals should be safely buried or destroyed and contact with their body fluids should be avoided without protective clothes. Veterinarians should maintain a high level of vigilance and report any unusual event detected in any animal species present in the markets to veterinary authorities.
Thus, no evidence exists to support the claim that a vegetarian lifestyle can protect someone from contracting COVID-19, a claim that has been debunked by both media outlets and the Indian government. Furthermore, the WHO and its China representative, Galea, have made no recommendations based on diet. Their statements instead focus on the possible risks of COVID-19 spreading in spaces where meat is exchanged, and methods to process and consume meat and poultry safely. 
Considering that information, we rate this claim as “False.”",FALSE

Since the early weeks of the U.S. COVID-19 coronavirus disease outbreak in March 2020, social media users began spreading claims that people who had gotten vaccinated to increase their immunity against seasonal influenza were at a higher risk of catching or testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The assertions took a variety of forms and resurged with new viral postings over weeks. In March and early April, many cited misinterpretations of a 2020 study by an epidemiologist with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) that examined how the 2017-2018 flu season affected personnel. “You can get coronavirus from the flu shot,” one person wrote to Snopes, referencing the DOD study (which we unpack below).
Then, in late April and May, the claims shifted to focus on remarks by anti-vaccine advocate and conspiracy theorist, Dr. Rashid Buttar, who said in a video interview posted on Facebook on April 19:
All the way back to 1984 all the way up to now, 2018, there are multiple studies that show that if you’ve had the flu shot… false positives on COVID-19 testing.
After that posting, numerous Facebook accounts circulated the below-displayed meme:

For the purpose of this investigation, we will first dissect what appear to be the main sources of the claim regarding flu shots — the DOD study that examined the health of military personnel (which is available via a five-page PDF) and Buttar, and then provide scientific and medical research that prove their invalidity. 
Greg Wolff, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch, conducted the study, examining whether the flu vaccine between October 2017 and September 2018 increased his colleagues’ risk for non-flu respiratory viruses, such as coronavirus, adenovirus or human bocavirus, via a phenomenon known as virus interference. Of the roughly 9,500 DOD employees he considered for the research — most of whom were male active duty service members between 18 and 35 years old — more than two-thirds had gotten flu shots that season; however, that group did not show significant odds of catching other respiratory illnesses compared to those who were not vaccinated, according to Wolff’s findings. The study states:
The overall results of the study showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination. Individual respiratory virus results were mixed, and some rebutted virus interference. Additionally those receiving the influenza vaccine were more likely to have no pathogen detected and reduced risk of influenza when compared to unvaccinated individuals.
In other words, the flu shot did not change the likelihood of test subjects overall catching other respiratory illnesses; however, each non-flu respiratory virus, such as coronavirus, showed varied results for how they impacted vaccinated DOD employees. At the same time, the vaccine protected personnel against influenza, the study found.
The idea of non-flu respiratory viruses showing individually different results on the test population is where anti-vaxxers focused their messaging. On April 16, 2020, more than three months after Wolff published the study, an anti-vaccine nonprofit called the Children’s Health Defense highlighted the DOD research on its website, with the headline, “Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36% (and Other Supporting Studies).”
Authored by the organization’s founder, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a high-profile leader of the U.S. modern anti-vaxx movement, the web page focused on one aspect of Wolff’s multi-pronged study of DOD personnel: 507 test subjects who did not have the flu and were vaccinated to increase their immunity against it tested positive for “coronavirus,” while only 170 test subjects who did not have an influenza vaccine tested positive for “coronavirus.” The study included the following table:

Wolff summarized that finding like this:
Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (which causes upper and lower respiratory disease with cold-like symptoms) in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals.
But nowhere did the epidemiologist describe the type of coronavirus(es) for which his subjects tested positive, and the Children’s Health Defense and other anti-vaxxers failed to make that distinction in their postings.
In science, the word “coronavirus” refers to a family of hundreds of viruses, not just one type of sickness. (Politicians and journalists frequently — and misleadingly — used the term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the novel coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.) Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seven types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans, some of which are fairly common and cause seasonal cold-like symptoms while others cause more severe and sometimes fatal infections, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The type of coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease is called SARS-CoV-2, and it was yet to be discovered at the time of Wolff’s study in 2017 and 2018. That means no one in the experiment was confirmed to have the virus that causes COVID-19, and Wolff did not once refer to the novel coronavirus in his research.
Additionally, considering the size and makeup of Wolff’s testing sample — as well as the overall findings of the study (mentioned above) and the fact that coronaviruses and influenza viruses vary by season and impact age groups differently — any assertion that the research definitely proves a connection between influenza vaccines and coronaviruses, including COVID-19, is misleading.
What Does Science Say?
According to the CDC, everyone 6 months and older should get an influenza vaccine each year to increase their chances of fighting the flu — even in the era of COVID-19 — though the effectiveness of the shot may vary person-to-person, year-to-year. The CDC states:
Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults. Therefore, getting vaccinated is a safer choice than risking illness to obtain immune protection.
In terms of whether the shot makes people more susceptible to other respiratory viruses, which in 2020 could include COVID-19, no strong scientific or medical evidence shows that flu shots increase people’s risk of catching other viruses as of this writing. One 2012 study in the peer-reviewed medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, which considered a test sample of 115 children and teens, suggested the flu vaccine might increase people’s odds of catching non-flu viruses. But a study one year later in the same peer-reviewed journal came to the opposite conclusion. The CDC said:
Many experts looked into this issue further and conducted additional studies to see if the findings (in the 2012 study of children and teens) could be replicated. No other studies have found this effect. …
It’s not clear why this finding was detected in the one study, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that influenza vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections.
Who Is Dr. Rashid Buttar?
Buttar, a licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine in North Carolina, is another leading source of the viral COVID-19-era claim that flu shots worsen your chances of catching the novel virus. In at least one spring 2020 video appearance (mentioned above), he claimed: “Studies clearly show that if you’ve had a flu shot, you’re going to test positive for COVID-19,” suggesting that the influenza vaccination contains antibodies that would make a person show a false positive on a COVID-19 test.
Buttar first gained public recognition via his hometown newspaper, the Charlotte Observer, in the late 1990s, advertising “advanced concepts in alternative and preventative medicine.” A few years later, he and another doctor gained news coverage for enrolling patients with heart disease in a controversial study that tested chelation therapy, a treatment to remove metals from patients’ bloodstream and commonly used to treat people with heavy metal poisoning.

But in the late 2000s, Buttar’s unconventional practices drew criticism. In 2007, the North Carolina Medical Board accused Buttar of “unprofessional conduct for departing from prevailing medical practice by treating patients with experimental, ineffective therapies and charging ‘exorbitant’ fees’ for unproven therapies that didn’t work,” the Charlotte Observer reported. A local TV station reported:
Buttar has spent years selling skin drops at $150 a bottle as a treatment for diseases ranging from autism to cancer.
A panel for the North Carolina Medical Board in 2008 ruled Buttar should stop treating children or patients with cancer because “his alternative medicine practice is below accepted medical standards in North Carolina.” But the doctor challenged that recommendation, and in 2010 the board and Buttar made a compromise: He could continue offering his treatments so long as his participants signed consent forms “acknowledging this practice is outside the mainstream,” according to the newspaper.
The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) over the years has also cautioned Buttar against marketing unapproved treatments as drugs via his YouTube channel and media appearances, among other warnings.
His efforts gained new popularity among online conspiracy and doomsday promoters during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Publishing weekly live-streamed videos and promoting the ideas of like-minded theorists including Judy Mikovits — a sole source for the factually challenged “Plandemic” video that went viral in May 2020 — Buttar was among anti-vaxxers who waged misinformation campaigns during the COVID-19 outbreak that challenged the news media’s portrayal of the pandemic and urged suspicion among followers about nefarious practices by physicians and politicians.
For example, he was among influencers who challenged in videos the CDC’s call for restrictions on in-person socializing to limit the spread of COVID-19, despite scientific evidence that the virus spreads via airborne particles when an infected person’s sneezes, coughs, or talks. Buttar is also among the YouTubers who have spread the false theory that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is using the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to push a mandatory vaccine, and he erroneously said online that a federal bill — H.R. 6666 — would authorize federally administered COVID-19 testing groups to enter homes and force testing against residents’ will, and then “take” those who test positive to quarantine sites.
In regards to his claim that the flu shot would make people test positive for COVID-19 even if they did not have the novel virus, flu shots are made one of two ways to build people’s immune systems without making them sick, according to the CDC: either from inactive flu viruses, which means they are not infectious, or a single gene from a flu virus. That means since COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, not a flu virus, it is not part of the influenza vaccine-manufacturing process at all and would not be transmitted via flu shots.
In sum, given that finding — as well as the false misrepresentation of the DOD study by anti-vaccine advocates — and the fact that the CDC states a “preponderance” of scientific and medical evidence exists to suggest that the flu vaccine does not affect people’s susceptibility to non-flu respiratory viruses, which in 2020 could include COVID-19, we rate this claim “False”.",FALSE

If you see an unaccompanied service dog in a vest, follow them.
Some service dogs are specially trained to seek out help if their owner is suffering from a debilitating medical emergency and are in need of assistance, according to a claim made on social media that Snopes readers asked our team to verify.

We rate this claim as mostly true. While some service dogs may go through special training that teaches them to seek help if their owner is experiencing a medical emergency, not all service dogs will have been taught such discipline.
The “Service Dog PSA” was originally shared on the social media platform Tumblr by user lumpatronics on June 12, 2018, by a user who identified as Tessa Connaughton. The woman described falling down, and her dog going off to seek help. Although the fall was “awful but ultimately harmless,” the original poster went on to say that she had epilepsy, and that her service dog was trained to find help if she was having a seizure.
“If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help,” she wrote.
The post subsequently went viral in June 2018 and was reported by several media outlets. It later became a Twitter moment when user @lissalet reshared the Tumblr PSA. (However, the original Twitter post has since been deleted, according to Twitter.) In a segment that aired on the Today Show at the time, a dog trainer said that a service dog will typically nudge a person’s legs to get their attention and if you see a dog in a vest without a person, “follow them.”

Service dogs are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ defines a service dog as one that has been “trained to take a specific action when needed to assist the person with a disability.” This includes a dog that is trained to detect the onset of a seizure and then help the person remain safe during the seizure for an owner with epilepsy.
But it is important to note that not all service dogs have been trained to find help when needed.
According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), that skill is found in a handful of specially trained service dogs, including those known as “seizure response” dogs trained to perform various behaviors in response to both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. assist people who suffer from epileptic and non-epileptic seizures.
Seizure response dogs are trained to bark and alert when their owner is experiencing a seizure. These animals may also lie next to their owners during a seizure to prevent injury while others may stand nearby to break a fall and prevent injury. Such dogs can also be trained to press alarm buttons or devices that call for help, and open and close doors, and find someone to help.
It is important to note that seizure response dogs are not the same as seizure alert dogs, which some people claim can predict when a seizure is coming. Paws with a Cause, a nonprofit organization that trains and provides seizure alert dogs, noted that this behavior may develop between a dog and a human as their relationship bonds, but it is not consistent or scientifically proven — though there is some evidence that dogs with particular personality traits may be more likely to alert someone when a seizure may occur.",mostly-true

6500.0,"A leaked Pentagon video reveals a government plot to vaccinate people against thoughts, ideas, and religion.","Does a Leaked Video Reveal a Government Plot to Vaccinate Against ‘Thoughts, Ideas, and Religion?’
The FunVax rumor largely hinges on the ""God gene"" theory, a bit of pop science that doesn't quite stand up to peer reviewed scrutiny.
On 20 January 2015, the disreputable web site Natural News published an article titled “600 strains of an aerosolized thought control vaccine already tested on humans; deployed via air, food and water.” According to the article, a “leaked Pentagon video” revealed the government had tested a mind-control vaccine dubbed FunVax (fundamentalist vaccine) on unwitting civilian populations.
The claim stated the vaccine was dispensed through large-scale spraying, vehicle exhaust, food, and water. (It should be noted with the exception of nasally administered flu vaccines, most vaccines are still dispensed through far more unwieldy syringes.) Central to the rumors were a single YouTube video described as a “leaked Pentagon presentation” and a link to a website on which those plans were purportedly detailed, like this rumor we collected from the internet:
Pentagon FunVax presentation on how the military can spread a virus and use a vaccine to extinguish “undesirable human behavior”. Behavior modification through vaccination. Say goodbye to your free will. 




The article explained while these claims have circulated since at least 2011 (the date of the video’s publication on YouTube), an increase in “medical police state” activity had enabled people to “connect the dots” about the covert deployment of this mind control vaccine:
As you’ll see in the document and video below, the vaccine was intended from the start to be deployed against civilian populations, and 600 strains of infectious viruses were tested on human subjects. One of the transmission vectors documented in the testing exploited an influenza strain to spread the mind-infecting virus as a pandemic.
The point of all this is to infect the minds of the population and transform people into what the government calls “normal.” From the government’s point of view, of course, “normal” means “obedient and mindless.”
This is all described in a video and a document that surfaced several years ago but which are only now beginning to connect the dots as the medical police state in America accelerates to insane levels of aggression against the population. See recent stories on medical kidnapping in Arkansas and CPS kidnapping of children in Arizona for starters.
The video that supposedly exposed the FunVax plot has been circulating the Internet since at least 2011, yet no event or circumstance has validated the claims made in or about it since its first appearance, and recent interest in the clip came about solely through its “discovery” by Natural News. The document appended as supplemental proof to the long-circulating video [PDF] is hosted on wanttoknow.info, a site devoted to discussion and dispersal of conspiracy-related material. While legitimate documents can and do sometimes emerge through what appear initially to be unreliable channels, no source is given for this “quarterly FunVax report” dated to June 2007. On the site itself, the poster of the document admitted the video and the document were possibly faked and no evidence corroborating their authenticity was known:
Though this may sound like some bizarre science fiction novel, the four-minute Pentagon video presentation and official FunVax report below show that this vaccine against fundamentalism is actively being tested for implementation. As it has been a few years since this date of this video and report, it is entirely possible this program has already been started.
There is some possibility that the above video and document are faked. But if they are, it is very intelligent disinformation. Who would spend all of the time and money required to come up with such a sophisticated and coherent story? And why? Knowing how science and the military often work together, a program like this is all too possible. I once attended a lecture by Al Gore’s science advisor in which he said he had been invited to see some of the most secret biological research programs being undertaken by the U.S. military. He said it gave him nightmares for months. 
It’s likely true a number of covert programs would send chills down the spines of most Americans were they made privy to the nuts and bolts of strategic defense planning, biological or otherwise. As to who might be responsible for such disinformation, that could be anyone’s guess. However, right around the time FunVax conspiracy theories began to circulate, an active Kickstarter campaign titled “FunVax — A Film About the Conspiracy” was launched by an individual named Ryan Harper. (The campaign ultimately failed to achieve its funding goal.)  Harper is also the registrant for the domain FunVax.com, a site ostensibly created to promote the film.
Notably, much of the speculation about FunVax occurred in 2011 and 2012 (Harper registered the domain in April 2011), and almost all claims made about it lead back to Harper and the film project. The clip in question was not “leaked” until September 2011, making the chronology of the FunVax conspiracy even more suspicious. While it’s possible a separate source disseminated the video as Harper endeavored to fund and film his documentary, there’s also no compelling evidence any information about FunVax originated from a source other than Harper himself.
As for that video, it too has provoked skepticism even among those who’ve not examined the source of the claims. All identifying details (such as date and context) were supplied by its original poster, and the low resolution of the footage makes it difficult to determine whether the audio portion was tacked on to an extant video from another source entirely.
Ultimately, those objections are secondary to the logistically and scientifically implausible aspects of the FunVax rumor. First and foremost, while the “God gene” is a popular bit of pop science, it isn’t supported by any peer-reviewed evidence:
Is the God gene real? The only evidence we have to go on at the moment is what Hamer presents in his book. He and his colleagues are still preparing to submit their results to a scientific journal. It would be nice to know whether these results can withstand the rigors of peer review. It would be nicer still to know whether any other scientists can replicate them. The field of behavioral genetics is littered with failed links between particular genes and personality traits. These alleged associations at first seemed very strong. But as other researchers tried to replicate them, they faded away into statistical noise. In 1993, for example, a scientist reported a genetic link to male homosexuality in a region of the X chromosome. The report brought a huge media fanfare, but other scientists who tried to replicate the study failed. The scientist’s name was Dean Hamer.
In short, the FunVax rumor originated largely with a filmmaker who sought to create a documentary of the same name about the “FunVax conspiracy.” The only evidence supporting the rumor is a YouTube video of questionable veracity and an unsourced document that purportedly describes the project. The entire concept of FunVax (which was supposedly already secretly developed, produced, and tested on unwitting Americans) hinged on a “God gene” theory that has yet to pass peer review or yield any known applications. Furthermore, this unproven gene theory supposedly inspired a wide-scale vaccination program involving technologies heretofore unseen in all other areas of working medical science. None of these related technologies (including vastly simplified and effective dispensation of vaccines) has ever been applied or even piloted in any areas of science or medicine before, and are so covert they are virtually unknown in documented pharmaceutical technology. Taken alone, these objections would cast the rumor into the territory of science fiction; all together, it’s pretty clear the claim is impossible on many levels.
It’s also worth mentioning the FunVax claim may sound slightly familiar to Firefly fans, as it very closely matches the main plot line of the film Serenity (spoiler alert):",FALSE

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


In March 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that 59 people in South Africa had died after a pastor told them to drink Dettol, a disinfectant cleaning product similar to Lysol, in order to prevent COVID-19 coronavirus disease. 
An article on the website Kenya Today was accompanied by an image supposedly showing this pastor, Rufus Phala, giving a woman Dettol to drink:

South African Prophet Rufus Phala allegedly gave his members of Dettol, a household bleach to drink as a preventing medicine to Coronavirus and also as a sign of faith during a church service.
Fifty-nine of them have been confirmed dead while four are in critical condition after drinking the Dettol.  
The claim that 59 people died after a pastor gave them Dettol to prevent coronavirus is false. This photograph is several years old, this news report has dubious origins, and this claim has been disputed by local authorities. 
South Africa police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo told the AFP news organization that this claim is false and that police were not involved in any investigations concerning 59 people who died from drinking Dettol.
This claim appears to be a variation of a rumor that has been circulating since 2016. At that time, it was reported that South African pastor Phala had told his congregation to consume cleaning products such as Dettol as a sort of miracle cure. The above-displayed photograph, which was widely shared in 2020 as if it showed a recent incident, was included in a report by South Africa’s The Citizen on the 2016 allegations against Phala. 
In fact, this image, as well as several similar ones, has been attached to a variety of dubious claims over the years. In 2018, for instance, these same photos were used to illustrate a story about six people dying after drinking bleach in church. In 2019, these same images accompanied claims of 27 people dying from drinking JIK, another cleaning solution, in order to cast out demons:

While it appears, based on 2016 press reports, that this pastor truly suggested the consumption of cleaning products in order to prevent or cure diseases, these photos do not come from March 2020 and are not evidence that 59 people died after a pastor told them to drink Dettol to prevent coronavirus.
It should be noted that drinking Dettol, Lysol, bleach, or any similar cleaning products could truly result in death. In fact, when it was reported in 2016 that Phala was using Dettol as a miracle cure, Dettol released a statement explaining that Dettol was could be dangerous to one’s health if ingested:
Dettol South Africa is aware of reports regarding Prophet Rufus Phala’s practice of instructing his congregation to drink Dettol Antiseptic Liquid.
Dettol Antiseptic Liquid has been proven to be safe and effective when used as per recommended directions. However, Dettol Antiseptic Liquid is not for human consumption and is for external use only, and we condemn the reported usage as inappropriate. Oral consumption of this product can be dangerous to one’s health.
We have been in contact with Prophet Rufus Phala and have asked him to stop this practice.

Research indicates that the hallucinogenic chemical in mushrooms may treat certain health issues.
In November 2020, the first non-palliative patient was successfully treated for anxiety and depression in Canada using the hallucinatory compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.
In August 2020, the Canadian government provided legal exemptions from drug laws to allow four patients experiencing end-of-life distress to receive medically administered treatment. Three months later, the first non-palliative patient was granted similar permission to receive treatment for her anxiety. However, there are currently no therapeutic products containing psilocybin approved in Canada for the general public. Below, we detail what’s been happening in Canada. 
The Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin
“Magic mushrooms” contain two chemical compounds, psilocybin and psilocin, that have hallucinogenic properties. Both chemicals have been controlled under Schedule III of Canada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) since 1974, making it illegal to sell, possess, produce, or use unless under certain circumstances, such as clinical trials or research.
A growing body of evidence has found that psilocybin may effectively treat conditions like anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly in people with life-threatening illnesses. However, as of this writing, there are no approved therapeutic psilocybin products in Canada, though the chemical is being studied for its potential to treat certain mental health conditions, like anxiety and depression.
Receiving an Exemption for Psilocybin Treatment
On Aug. 4, 2020, four individuals who experienced end-of-life distress were granted an exemption to the CDSA — the first people in Canada to receive such an exemption for psilocybin and received treatment from TheraPsil, a psilocybin treatment advocacy and research group.
Since that decision, the organization supported nine other individuals who received approved exemptions for psilocybin, one of whom was Mona Strelaeff, the first non-palliative individual to have been granted an exemption. Her story was originally reported by Vice and Holly Bennett, a spokesperson for TheraPsil, who confirmed that Strelaeff was successfully treated with psilocybin therapy by psychotherapist and TheraPsil founder, Dr. Bruce Tobin, on Nov. 5.
“Mona suffered from unresolved trauma which manifested as depression, anxiety and addiction, and was granted a section 56 exemption for psilocybin on Oct. 4,” Bennett said. “To date, 13 individuals have been granted psilocybin exemptions — 12 palliatives, and one non-palliative.”
Since the Aug. 4 decision, Bennett said that TheraPsil received dozens of requests from both palliative and non-palliative individuals who are requesting support with receiving an exemption. At the time of this writing, the company has not opened intake criteria to non-palliative individuals.
How the Treatment Works
A psilocybin treatment administered by TheraPsil includes three sessions. In the pre-sessions, a therapist and patient work together to build a relationship and trust, as well as set their intention for their journey. During the “medicine session,” a patient is given psilocybin normally in the presence of two therapists in a setting where they feel safe, which typically lasts around six hours. A patient will often wear eyeshades to block out visual distractions and listen to a curated playlist to help the patient focus inward and “explore layers of their psyche which may not be available to them in their ordinary state of consciousness.”
Following the medicine session, a patient continues to work with a therapist to describe and understand their thoughts, feelings, and emotions that came up during the medicine session.
“For example, one patient who has been very open about her experience, Laurie Brooks, from BC, said during her medicine session she ‘saw her cancer as being in a box beside her on the floor,’” said Bennett. “This image was integrated during therapy so she could continue to hold this feeling of separation from her illness, and no longer let her cancer hang over her like a dark cloud.”





Psilocybin Treatment in the United States
In Canada, exemptions to the CDSA are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and there are no formal therapy regulations currently in place. Like its neighbor, the U.S. has not lifted federal regulations for therapeutic purposes and considers psilocybin as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act in 2020. (Other Schedule I drugs include heroin and LSD.) But several local governments have decriminalized “magic mushrooms” and their hallucinatory effects, including the city of Oakland, California, and the state of Oregon.
Currently, at least one clinical trial is underway in the U.S. to determine the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in participants with treatment-resistant depression.
Because the use of psilocybin was approved by the Canadian government in certain exempt cases for specific medical purposes, but not at a national level for the general treatment of anxiety and depression, we rate this claim as “Mostly true.”",mostly-true
6481.0,Hand sanitizers gradually become less effective after their expiration date.,"Is Hand Sanitizer Effective After Its Expiration Date?
Questions about the longevity of hand sanitizers arose after the product started flying off store shelves during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.
As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Read our coronavirus fact checks. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


Hand sanitizers were flying off grocery store shelves in early 2020 amid the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, leading to shortages around the United States. While washing hands thoroughly and frequently with soap is the most highly recommended method of preventing the spread of the virus, many people were turning to hand sanitizers.  
We received questions about the effectiveness of sanitizers after their expiration date from people who were concerned about using old sanitizer they found in their storage. Some questioned whether hand sanitizers even needed an expiration date, and if the alcohol in them could really “expire.”  
The answer is somewhat complicated. According the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), over-the-counter drugs must list an expiration date unless data show they are stable for more than three years. However, the FDA “does not have information on the stability or effectiveness of drug products past their expiration date.”
What Active Ingredient Makes Sanitizer Effective?
Hand sanitizer needs to have 60% to 95% alcohol to be effective at killing germs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Hand sanitizers without alcohol are not as effective for most germs, and in most cases, they reduce the number of germs but do not kill them. 
How Does Hand Sanitizer Expire?
Hand sanitizers with alcohol generally take two to three years to expire, and because the FDA regulates them, they are required by law to have an expiration date on their packaging. 
According to Insider, the alcohol evaporates quickly when exposed to air. So, when someone pops open the bottle of sanitizer, the alcohol content will gradually decrease over time, since most closed containers are not airtight. As a result, the sanitizer becomes less effective over time. According to Healthline:
The manufacturer estimates how long it’ll take for the percentage of the active ingredient to drop below 90% of the percentage stated on the label. That time estimate becomes the expiration date.
However, sealed bottles of sanitizer will maintain relatively more alcohol content after their expiration date, especially if they have not yet been exposed to air. According to Insider:
If a bottle hasn’t been opened, less of the alcohol will have evaporated, so a freshly-opened bottle of hand-sanitizer that is past its expiration date will likely be more effective than a bottle that is expired and has already been opened.
That said, if expired hand sanitizer is your only option, and you have no access to soap and water, use it. Alex Berezow, microbiologist and vice president of scientific communications at the American Council on Science and Health, said in an interview with Insider, “Some alcohol is better than nothing.” 
Washing Hands with Soap and Water Still the Best Option
Hand sanitizers should not be prioritized over hand-washing with soap, according to the CDC, because they do not eliminate all types of germs:
Soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at removing certain kinds of germs, like Cryptosporidium, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile. Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers can inactivate many types of microbes very effectively when used correctly, people may not use a large enough volume of the sanitizers, or may wipe it off before it has dried.
Thus, based on guidance from the CDC and experts, hand sanitizers should be used as a secondary option to hand-washing, and are less effective at killing germs after they’ve been opened and their expiration date has passed. The alcohol content in sealed containers, however, possibly remains almost the same after the expiration date because it has not been exposed to air. We therefore rate the overall truth of this claim as “Mixture.”",mixture

Illegal organ trafficking in China had dire consequences for this teenager’s technological aspirations.
Back in 2011, a teenager in China sold his kidney on the organ trafficking black market so he could get enough money to buy the latest Apple devices. The story — which has still circulated on the internet years later because of its shocking details — highlighted the ever-present problem of organ trafficking in China.
The then-17-year-old, identified by the BBC as Xiao Zheng (Little Zheng), and by NPR with the surname Wang, told media that he had wanted to buy an iPad, but couldn’t afford the cost. He communicated with a kidney agent online, and voluntarily sold his right kidney in an illegal procedure that took place in China’s Hunan province. According to Xinhua News Agency, a Chinese media outlet, five people — including the surgeon who performed the procedure — were charged with intentional injury and organ trading. One of the defendants reportedly received 220,000 yuan (about US $33,000) for arranging the transplant, which he split with others involved in the transaction.
The boy received only 22,000 yuan (about US $3,500) from the entire transaction, and used it to purchase an iPad and iPhone, expensive gadgets that made his mother suspicious when he bought them. He eventually admitted to his mother that he had sold a kidney.
Soon afterwards, the boy and his family learned that he suffered from “renal insufficiency,” a decreased level of kidney function, and his condition was deteriorating. As of 2019, the 25-year-old was attached to a dialysis machine, and it was reported that he was likely to be bedridden for life.
China banned the trade of human organs in 2007, but a shortage of donors has led to a booming black market for organs.

Origins:   On 2 November 2014, rumors
began to circulate (mainly via Twitter) that three “Doritos factory workers” had tested positive for the Ebola virus and, consequently, untold numbers of Doritos bags had been potentially contaminated with the virus.
The rumor of Ebola-infected Doritos mimicked a somewhat-similar rumor that a chocolate factory worker in Africa had contaminated Halloween candy after bleeding into batches of food.
However, the Doritos rumor was a false one deliberately promulgated by fabricated news stories. Manufactured images of “breaking news” attributed to large media outlets such CNN and Fox News enabled the claim to spread rapidly:

  


  


Almost as quickly as it started, the Ebola in Doritos claim was exposed as the work of 4chan, a popular message board known for propagating similar pranks. A spokesperson for Frito-Lay addressed the rumor:


Internet rumors associating the Ebola virus with one of our packaged snack foods are absolutely and entirely false. While the Doritos brand is always a hot topic in social media, it is unfortunate someone chose to use this or any brand for such an insensitive prank.


The rumor of Ebola-infected Doritos plant workers is not only false but scientifically contradicted. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has explained countless times that Ebola cannot be transmitted through food.",FALSE

A preliminary report released in November 2020 claimed that over-the-counter mouthwashes that contained the antimicrobial ingredient cetylyridinium chloride (CPC) showed signs of reducing COVID-19 in saliva — a “promising” find as the world raced to find therapeutics and vaccinations to combat the novel coronavirus.
The findings were published by a long list of news outlets, including BBC News and CNBC, and became a Twitter moment on Nov. 17. Some headlines made bold claims like “Mouthwash Can Kill COVID-19 in 30 Seconds, Study Reveals,” and as such generalized coverage swept the internet, Snopes readers asked our reporters to dig in and verify the veracity of this report.

While it is true that the findings show promise that CPC could reduce COVID-19 in saliva, it is important to note several caveats with the study.
Firstly, the preliminary results are published ahead of a clinical trial in the preprint server for biology bioRxiv, meaning that they have not been peer-reviewed and larger scale testing has yet to be conducted at the time of writing.
Cardiff University researchers behind the most recent mouthwash study conducted an “in vitro” experiment, which means that it was not tested on humans but rather mimicked conditions found in the pharynx passage, the part of the throat located behind the mouth and nasal cavity that connects to the esophagus. Researchers exposed the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus to two rinses containing CPC and a third containing a combination of ethanol and essential oils over the course of 30 seconds.
Mouthwashes that contained at least .07% CPC showed signs of inactivating the novel coronavirus. That doesn’t kill it but rather eliminates the virus’ ability to invade host cells. Neither ethanol nor chlorhexidine alone was shown to have an impact on the virus.
But there are some important limitations to the study worth noting. While mouthwashes were shown to be effective at eradicating the virus in a laboratory setting, it is not yet clear to what extent these results will be mimicked in real people. It also doesn’t directly indicate how mouthwash may reduce viral transmission between patients.
“This study adds to the emerging literature that several commonly available mouthwashes designed to fight gum disease can also inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (and other related coronaviruses) when tested in the laboratory under conditions that are designed to mimic the oral/nasal cavity in a test tube,” said Dr. Richard Stanton, lead author on the study and a reader in virology at Cardiff University, in a university news release.
Despite these limitations, the findings confirm previous studies that suggest CPC could reduce the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, which could help to reduce transmission between individuals. A study published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases in September found that gargling with an over-the-counter mouthwash for 30 seconds was “highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9%.” Another study published in October in the British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery furthered that saliva and oral cavities may serve as a potential reservoir for COVID-19 transmission, suggesting that mouthwashes could reduce transmission — but again, there is no clinical evidence to date that definitively confirms such findings.
“Overall antimicrobial mouthwash may help in decreasing viral load in the oropharynx but this should not be viewed as using mouthwash instead of face masks, but instead as a potential combined intervention: use of mouthwash and wearing face masks,” said Professor Jean-Yves Maillard, Professor of Pharmaceutical Microbiology at Cardiff University, in a statement.
“The remaining question is how often one needs to use a mouthwash to really make an impact? This would need to be answered before any recommendations are made.”
Listerine owner Johnson & Johnson issued a statement in response to the findings, urging consumers to continue to use products as directed until further clinical evidence proves otherwise. 
No. LISTERINE® mouthwash has not been tested against any strains of coronavirus. Only some LISTERINE® mouthwash formulations contain alcohol, and if present is only around 20% alcohol. LISTERINE® mouthwash is not intended to be used, nor would it be beneficial as a hand sanitizer or surface disinfectant. LISTERINE® Antiseptic is clinically proven to kill 99.9 % of germs that cause bad breath, plaque and gingivitis.

No. LISTERINE® Antiseptic is a daily mouthwash which has been proven to kill 99.9% of germs that cause bad breath, plaque and gingivitis. LISTERINE® mouthwash has not been tested against the coronavirus and is not intended to prevent or treat COVID-19.
Researchers at Cardiff University intend to next examine how effective mouthwash is in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the saliva of COVID-19-positive patients at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Results of this study are slotted for publication in early 2021. At the time of publication, several other studies are underway to determine how effective antiseptic mouthwash may be in preventing COVID-19 spread, including one at the University of California San Francisco that is expected to be completed in August 2021.
Both Listerine and the scientific community caution that using mouthwash is not a cure for COVID-19, nor is it an effective preventative measure. Consumers should continue to follow recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the World Health Organization, including washing hands frequently, maintaining social distance, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.",mixture

In November 2020, social media users started to spread screenshots that supposedly showed a Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document that detailed an alleged plan by the agency to implement “green zones,” or COVID-19 containment camps, to stop the spread of the pandemic:

The CDC is not recommending the implementation of COVID-19 containment camps. This rumor is based on a months-old document that explored the various factors that would have to be considered if “green zones” were ever deemed necessary to control the pandemic. 
Social media users shared cherry-picked screenshots of this document on social media along with  worrisome messages warning that the CDC was advocating for setting up concentration camps. One person, for example, wrote: “Are you effin kidding me?!?!? Fight this!!!! CDC advocating putting high risk people in green zone “camps”?!?!? Away from family members?!?!? Nazi’s!”
These social media posts are based on a genuine page from the CDC website entitled “Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.” While this page, which was first published in July 2020, does talk about “high-risk individuals” being “temporarily relocated to safe or green zones,” describing this document as a CDC “recommendation” or “plan” is inaccurate.
This document presents various factors that would need to be considered before such a plan could be made. In its opening paragraph, it’s explained that “the purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data.” In other words, this document shows that the CDC has started to consider what actions would be required (and what impact they would have on individuals) if such action was deemed necessary.
It should also be noted that in the four months since the publication of document, no such “green zones” or COVID-19 containment camps have been constructed. Rather, the CDC has advocated for the public to wear face masks, wash their hands, and practice social distancing.

The claim, which has spread across the anti-vaccine internet zeitgeist without context, stems from a GoFundMe page whose organizer has since walked back her claims.

On Nov. 12, 2020, a GoFundMe page titled “Medical and Child Care Expenses” was created by the cousin of a participant involved in a clinical trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Snopes is withholding the participant’s last name for privacy reasons. 
“Patricia was involved in a COVID-19 vaccine study recently and has had a severe adverse reaction,” the post originally stated. “She has not been able to walk or go to work for almost three weeks now because of huge bleeding sores on her feet. These sores are called a Fixed Drug Eruption…”
Screenshots from this GoFundMe page have since been used as evidence of the danger of the COVID-19 vaccine on Facebook, Twitter, and fringe news websites, each of which blindly assert a causal connection between the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the foot sores, based on these pictures:

On Nov. 30, 2020, however, the creator of the GoFundMe page told potential donors that Patricia had learned she was actually in the control group — i.e., people given an injection of saline solution instead of the actual vaccine for comparison purposes:
Patricia is still suffering from the painful skin condition on her feet; however, the cause has become unclear.  The manufacturer of the vaccine has unblinded her due to this safety concern and it has been discovered she was in the placebo arm of the trial.
In other words, the vaccine could not have caused this condition because she was never actually given the vaccine. In a video update, Patricia stated, “So just to clarify … the vaccine manufacturer is standing their ground that I received the placebo, which is allegedly just sterile saline. … I’m going to seek a second opinion because I don’t know what the hell caused this.” We reached out to the organizer of the GoFundMe to see if there had been any medical updates in her case, but have not received a response.
We reached out to Pfizer to confirm Patricia’s account of events. In response, they told us:
This individual was enrolled in a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine trial, as she has disclosed. We can definitively state, however, that this individual’s medical condition (alleged “Fixed Drug Eruption”) is not related to her participation in the trial. We have contacted GoFundMe on two occasions regarding this matter, and as a result, the site has shut down the related fundraising page. More generally, as stated in our press release, no serious safety concerns have been observed in our trial.
While GoFundMe told us that they did temporarily remove the fundraiser, they restored the page after updated information was provided:
The fundraiser was initially suspended by our Trust & Safety team. As a general point, fundraisers whose claims cannot be verified violate GoFundMe’s Terms of Service and will be removed from the platform. After receiving more information from the organizer, the fundraiser is again actively receiving donations. I’ll point you to their latest updates.
We’re a site that requires transparency and because the intent of the fundraiser has changed, we asked the organizer to post an update for donors. GoFundMe is honoring any refund requests which is part of our comprehensive refund policy to ensures donors’ intentions are honored.
However, because the alleged victim of the COVID-19 trial publicly disclosed that she had been informed that she was in the placebo group, and because Pfizer has told us they can “definitively state … that this individual’s medical condition is not related to her participation in the trial,” we rank the claim that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine caused painful foot sores as “False.”",FALSE

6647.0,A video shows a group of people celebrating the end of COVID-19 restrictions in New Zealand.,"Are These New Zealanders Celebrating the End of COVID-19 Restrictions?
In June 2020, New Zealand lifted all social distancing restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic after going two weeks without a confirmed case.
On June 9, 2020, a video supposedly showing a group of people at a bar excitedly celebrating the end of coronavirus stay-at-home restrictions in New Zealand went viral on social media:
 New Zealanders celebrating having eliminated COVID-19 as soon as the country went into level 1 (no more social distancing) from      nextfuckinglevel 
 
This video came as a surprise to some viewers during a time when most of the world, including the United States, is still dealing with the social distancing, business restrictions, and other safety policies put in place to combat COVID-19. 
The above-displayed video is real and truly shows a group celebrating the end of COVID-19 restrictions in New Zealand. This video was taken at Danger Danger bar in Wellington as the clock struck midnight on June 9, 2020, ending the country’s social distancing enforcement. 
Matt McLaughlin, the owner of Danger Danger, told Australia’s Stuff news outlet the following:
“It’s a great video of midnight hitting and everyone jumping off their chairs and jumping on the dance floor. It’s quite hard case… People want to socialise. They’ve been cooped up for three months, and they want to get out and see their friends.”
According to the BBC, the above-displayed video captured the moment that New Zealand officially moved to a “level one” on their four-tier alert system, meaning that all social distancing guidelines put in place during the pandemic were removed. There are now no limits on public gatherings (which means sports, concerts, and other large public gatherings can take place) and effectively no restrictions on business operations.
But one COVID-19 policy remains: New Zealand’s borders will remain closed to foreigners for the time being. 
While Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was not at the Danger Danger bar the when the video was taken, she did tell reporters that she did a “little dance” when she learned that New Zealand no longer had any active cases of COVID-19:
“While we’re in a safer, stronger position, there’s still no easy path back to pre-Covid life, but the determination and focus we have had on our health response will now be vested in our economic rebuild … While the job is not done, there is no denying this is a milestone. So can I finish with a very simple, ‘Thank you, New Zealand’.”",TRUE

6640.0,Asheville police officers destroyed a medic tent and its supplies while enforcing a curfew during a protest against police brutality.,"Did Asheville Police Destroy a Medic Tent Made for Protesters?
The Asheville police chief later said the incident “embarrassed our city and our department.”
During a June 2, 2020 protest against police brutality and racial injustice in Asheville, North Carolina, police in riot gear destroyed a medic tent operated by an “all-volunteer team of doctors, certified nurses, EMTs, military combat medics, and citizens with CPR and first-aid certifications.” According to the Asheville Citizen-Times, the team “had a verbal agreement with APD to be present, even after curfew.”
Nevertheless, a scene captured by witnesses minutes after the curfew began showed police forcibly removing volunteers, crushing and emptying water bottles, and destroying the tent:





One volunteer said, “We were not protesting. We were not agitating. We had claimed that space. We had set up a triage area in case of any injuries. We had eyewash, sutures, EMT, doctors, EMS workers. They came in full riot gear, hit us with shields, threw several people to the ground. We were grabbed, thrown, shouted at, screamed at, treated as criminals. No one resisted.” Videos of the tent’s destruction went viral, and public outrage followed.
The Asheville Police Department’s initial statement from Chief David Zack on June 3, 2020, confirmed that the incident took place, but defended the department’s actions, largely placing blame for the incident on the medical volunteers:
As the Chief of Police I understand the concern has been raised over the destruction of water, food, and medical supplies. The Asheville Police Department (APD) would always prefer confiscation over destruction. We apologize for not being able to confiscate these supplies last night.
Over the past three days APD has tried to eliminate objects that can be thrown at protesters and law enforcement. Because water bottles, in particular, have been continuously used over the last three nights, officers destroyed them. Officers also searched for potentially dangerous objects, such as explosives.
The supply station was not permitted by the City of Asheville and was located on private property, without the permission of the property owner. The actions involving the supply station occurred following multiple warnings, and after the 8 p.m. city-wide curfew.
But this statement from the chief only exacerbated tensions in Asheville.
Sean Miller, one of the organizers of the medic tent, told a local CBS affiliate that the statement was “shocking.”
Miller continued, saying, “We had no explosives. There was nothing that could have been perceived as an explosive.”
Faced with continued backlash, Zack, who has been on the job just four months, released a second statement on June 4, 2020, this time apologizing for his department’s role in the incident:
I am David Zack, chief of the Asheville police department, speaking to you today to address a matter that has deeply affected our community, embarrassed our city and our department. Of course, I am referring to the destruction of a medic tent during protests on Tuesday, June 2nd. For these actions, I am truly sorry.
Some may find this message to be too little too late, and that’s fair. Yesterday’s statement was inadequate in addressing your concerns. And I apologize for that as well. …  I know you’ve been promised change in the past, but you’ve yet to hear that promise from me. Police reform needs to be more than a conversation. There needs to be action. And I assure you, action is forthcoming.
Because the incident was captured in multiple videos and has been confirmed by the Asheville Police Department itself, the claim that officers forcibly destroyed a medic tent during a protest against police brutality is “True.”",TRUE

An article titled “COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data” that was published on Nov. 22, 2020, in Johns Hopkins’ student-run newspaper The News-Letter was retracted after it claimed that COVID-19 has had “relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.”

There was nothing false about the article. It was completely consistent with the CDC’s current count of deaths from all causes, which is right where it should be for week 47 with no excess deaths from COVID-19. This is 1984 on steroids https://t.co/eIqbOKwcA6
— Tom Mullen (@ThomasMullen) November 27, 2020

While it is true that The News-Letter retracted and unpublished the article on Nov. 26 over concerns that key points were inaccurately reported and contributed to the spread of misinformation, the publication shared an editorial update the following day explaining its decision and sharing a link to the article as a PDF with an overlay that reads “Retracted by The News-Letter. (For reference, a PDF of the article can be viewed here, and a web version has been archived here.)
The article in question was written by science and technology writer Yanni Gu, who was a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine at the time. Gu interviewed Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master’s degree program, who was said to have “critically analyzed” the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. death using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a webinar given the same title of the article, “COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data.”
According to Gu’s article, Briand sourced data from mid-March to mid-September that reported a total of 1.7 million deaths, about 200,000 of which were related to COVID-19. A link to this data was not made available in the article, but data published by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center showed that at least 200,000 people had reportedly died from the virus as of Sept. 21 (for comparison, total deaths had reached over 268,000 people at the time of this writing, Dec. 2). The article went on to push a narrative that has circulated since the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic that argues the CDC has falsely classified any death that could be related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths, rather than accounting for other potential causes or underlying conditions. (See other examples of similar falsities here, here, here, and here.)
“Even patients dying from underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths,” wrote Gu. “This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.
Briand said in an interview with The News-Letter that her findings point “to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths,” and that “total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. When asked whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading by this presumed inflation, Briand responded by saying that the way in which the data was reported “doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification.”
“In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes,” wrote Gu.
Editors at The News-Letter wrote in a Nov. 27 note that Genevieve Briand’s presentation had been “used to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic. In response to criticism following the editorial staff’s decision to retract the article, the paper issued the following statement:
In accordance with our standards for transparency, we are sharing with our readers how we came to this decision. The News-Letter is an editorially and financially independent, student-run publication. Our articles and content are not endorsed by the University or the School of Medicine, and our decision to retract this article was made independently.
Briand’s study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
As assistant director for the Master’s in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher. At her talk, she herself stated that more research and data are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S.
The staff noted other inaccuracies in Briand’s claims that have been debunked and refuted by the broader medical community. For one, her claim that there is no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths did not take into account the spike in raw death count from all causes when compared to previous years. Furthermore, the CDC reported on Oct. 23 that an estimated 299,028 excess U.S. COVID-19 deaths occurred between late January through Oct. 3.
“Additionally, Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic,” continued The News-Letter in its editor’s note. “This evidence does not disprove the severity of COVID-19; an increase in excess deaths is not represented in these proportionalities because they are offered as percentages, not raw numbers.”
Removing misreported content has been a source of controversy in the journalism world, with groups like the Society of Professional Journalism and The Pointer Institute arguing that such actions reduce the transparency and credibility of a publication that does so.

A meme alleged she said Black Americans ""must be"" first in line for a vax, just behind heath care workers.
In June 2020, social media users shared a meme containing text that claimed Melinda Gates said Black Americans “must be” first in line to receive a potential vaccine for coronavirus just after medical workers:

Gates and her husband, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, run a public health advocacy non-profit called the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. She didn’t say that Black people “must be” vaccinated after health care workers but rather suggested they should be, given known deleterious effects of the virus on people of color. Her comment came in response to a question from a Time magazine journalist who asked, “Who needs [a potential COVID-19 vaccine] after health care workers?” In response to the question, she said:
In the U.S., that would be black people next, quite honestly, and many other people of color. They are having disproportionate effects from COVID-19. From there, people with underlying health conditions, and then people who are older. Those are the ones who all need it first. We also need to think about essential workers who are keeping our grocery stores open for us so we can buy food, or who are making sure that food moves through the warehouses.
Her statement references data that show Black people have a higher risk of dying from the COVID-19 than white people. However, some people on social media gave the comment a conspiratorial meaning. Here is one such example, with the user’s name cropped out for privacy:

The reference to Tuskegee above refers to the Tuskegee Study, in which the U.S. government used Black men as test subjects in a 40-year study about untreated syphilis in which they were not told researchers weren’t actually treating them for the disease.
We rate this claim “True” because Melinda Gates did say that she believed Black people, who are at high risk for falling ill and dying from COVID-19, should be among the first vaccinated. But we note that some are interpreting her statement misleadingly. She did not say, for instance, they “must be” vaccinated against their will.",TRUE

The picture was shared in a news release from Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital after surgeons there performed a successful double-lung transplant on a COVID-19 coronavirus patient, an otherwise healthy woman in her 20s.
Northwestern Medical writes:
For the first time, surgeons at Northwestern Medicine performed a double-lung transplant on a patient whose lungs were damaged by COVID-19. The patient, a Hispanic woman in her 20s, spent six weeks in the COVID ICU on a ventilator and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a life support machine that does the work of the heart and lungs. By early June, the patient’s lungs showed irreversible damage. The lung transplant team listed her for a double-lung transplant, and 48 hours later, performed the life-saving procedure at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
“A lung transplant was her only chance for survival,” says Ankit Bharat, MD, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the Northwestern Medicine Lung Transplant Program. “We are one of the first health systems to successfully perform a lung transplant on a patient recovering from COVID-19. We want other transplant centers to know that while the transplant procedure in these patients is quite technically challenging, it can be done safely, and it offers the terminally ill COVID-19 patients another option for survival.”
Northwestern Medicine reported that this woman, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy, was healthy before she contracted the virus. The woman was sick for about two weeks before she was admitted to the hospital at the end of April. She was place on a ventilator, but her condition continued to worsen, and soon her lungs were damaged beyond repair.
Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the Northwestern Medicine Lung Transplant Program, said in the same write-up that this COVID-19 patient’s only hope was a lung transplant. But doctors had to wait until she tested negative for the disease, and her organs were healthy enough, to proceed with the delicate procedure.
Bharat also spoke to The New York Times about the life-saving surgery. While Bharat said that he wanted people to know that this operation could save COVID-19 patients with severely damaged lungs, he added that this surgery wasn’t a viable option for every COVID-19 patient: 
The 10-hour surgery was more difficult and took several hours longer than most lung transplants because inflammation from the disease had left the woman’s lungs “completely plastered to tissue around them, the heart, the chest wall and diaphragm,” said Dr. Ankit Bharat, the chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the lung transplant program at Northwestern Medicine, which includes Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in an interview.

An old interview with Dr. Fauci made new rounds on social media during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020.
Another rumor about the efficacy of wearing masks during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic made the rounds in June 2020, a topic we have debunked numerous times at Snopes. A “60 Minutes” interview from early March 2020 with Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leading members of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, was being regurgitated on social media. In the segment,  Fauci said there was no reason people in the U.S. needed to wear a mask.
The problem? That clip is old, and Fauci was simply echoing what many others argued at that time, including the U.S. Surgeon General, the World Health Organization (WHO), and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since then, Fauci’s views and that of most organizations have changed, as more information became available about the disease.





In the March 2020 clip, Fauci said: “Right now in the United States people should not be walking around with masks … You should think of healthcare providers who are needing them and the people who are ill.” 
Since at least April 2020, the CDC recommended that everyone wear cloth masks in public to help slow the spread of COVID-19. That recommendation changed because of studies that found even people without coronavirus symptoms, but who may still have the disease, could transmit the virus through close interactions with others, especially through speaking, coughing, and sneezing: 
In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) … 
Snopes has also covered the efficacy of masks in past fact checks, including the evolving recommendations of the U.S. surgeon general and the effectiveness of cloth masks in preventing the spread of the virus. 
Fauci also clarified in a June interview that masks are helpful “… but it’s masks plus physical separation.” This is in line with the CDC guideline that, “The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.”
Given that the quote from Fauci is no longer current, we rate this claim as “Outdated.”",FALSE

7620.0,A November 2020 study found that vegetarian and vegan diets can put people at higher risk for either total or site-specific bone fractures.,"Are Vegans and Vegetarians More Likely To Suffer Broken Bones?
Keep in mind, snacking on the conclusions of one study cannot replace a complete diet of nuanced and evolving information.
A study published on Nov. 23, 2020, found that non-meat eaters, especially vegans, were at higher risk of experiencing bone fractures. The study was published in the BMC Medicine journal and was conducted by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition’s (EPIC) Oxford University cohort.
According to the study, previous research showed vegetarians had lower bone mineral density (BMD) — a measure of the amount of minerals contained in a certain volume of bone, also known as bone mass — than non-vegetarians, but associating vegetarian diets with fracture risks was unclear.
Nearly 55,000 men and women across the United Kingdom responded to questionnaires in the beginning of the study between 1993 and 2001, and again in 2010. Respondents were categorized as meat eaters, fish eaters (did not eat meat but ate fish), vegetarians (did not eat meat or fish, but ate one or both of dairy and eggs), and vegans (participants who did not eat meat, fish, dairy, or eggs).
The study concluded:
Overall, we found that compared with meat eaters, vegans had higher risks of total, hip, leg, and vertebral fractures, while fish eaters and vegetarians had a higher risk of hip fractures. These risk differences were likely partly due to their lower BMI (Body Mass Index), and possibly to lower intakes of calcium and protein.
We should note that there were several caveats. The study stated that “bone health in vegans requires further research,” and the study authors were operating with some limitations:
More studies are needed especially from non-European and contemporary populations to examine the generalisability of our findings and to explore possible heterogeneity by factors including age, sex, menopausal status, and BMI.
Nutrient intake was also self-reported by the participants instead of measured by the researchers, which could sometimes make the data less reliable. One potential concern they identified was the ability to capture all fracture cases: “The outcome data were ascertained based on hospital records, which reduced misreporting and selective loss to follow-up, although a possible limitation of this approach was that less serious fractures that did not require hospitalisation would not have been captured.”
Based on the results of this one study and its caveats, we can state that this claim is a mixture of truth and falsehood.",mixture

In December 2020, Snopes readers asked us to verify an extraordinary claim made in several news articles around that time — namely that the coronavirus pandemic had hit North Dakota so hard that one in 800 residents of the state had died from COVID-19. 
On Dec. 1, Forbes reported that:
Just two weeks after joining the growing list of states where at least one in every 1,000 residents has died from coronavirus-linked causes, North Dakota’s grim statistic has escalated: as of Tuesday [Dec. 1], one in every 800 North Dakotans has been claimed by COVID-19. 
The North Dakota Department of Health confirmed 409 new cases and 27 additional deaths in the state on Monday [Nov. 30], bringing the total death toll to 954 out of a population of roughly 762,000, or 0.97 in every 800 residents. 
The Grand Forks Herald published a similar claim in its report on Dec. 1, and Bloomberg reporter Steven Dennis posted a widely shared tweet to the same effect.

On Dec. 3, Daily Mail published slightly different figures, reporting that:
North Dakota has become the eighth deadliest state in the coronavirus pandemic per capita… On Tuesday, cumulative virus deaths since March in North Dakota hit 966, out of a population of 762,000, meaning that roughly one in 788 state residents has succumbed to the pandemic. That still trails far behind the deadliest state, New Jersey, where roughly one in 580 residents has died because of the virus, according to state data.
All of the figures stated above were accurate at the time they were published. 
For example, on Dec. 1 the North Dakota Department of Health stated that the cumulative total number of deaths from COVID-19 in the state through Nov. 30 was 954, with 27 new deaths reported on Nov. 30 itself. Population estimates are not yet available for 2020, but the most recent official figure from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Communities Survey estimated North Dakota’s population as 762,062 as of July 1, 2019. 
Based on that population estimate, 0.125 % of North Dakotans had died from COVID-19 through Nov. 30, 2020 — one out of every 799 residents, vindicating the headline claim made by Forbes, the Herald, and Dennis. 
One obvious note of caution here is that the population estimate used in arriving at that conclusion is 17 months old. If North Dakota’s population rose in that intervening period, then the proportion of North Dakotans who died from COVID-19 would have been slightly lower than one in 800 as of Nov. 30. Equally, if the population decreased since July 2019, then the one-in-800 milestone would have been reached even earlier in the year.
On Dec. 2, the North Dakota Department of Health stated that the cumulative total number of deaths from COVID-19 through Dec. 1 had reached 966, just as Daily Mail reported. Using the same 2019 population estimate as a base, this would mean one in every 789 North Dakotans had died from COVID-19 by that time. 
On Dec. 4, when this fact check was originally published, the state posted the official figures for Dec. 3, providing an updated death count from the virus of 989 people — meaning one out of every 771 North Dakotans had died from COVID-19 by that time.
As Forbes and Daily Mail both noted, North Dakota’s COVID-19 death rate, although high, is not the highest in the country. Using Dec. 4 data from the New Jersey Department of Health and the July 2019 population estimate for the state, one out of every 576 New Jerseyans had died from COVID-19 by Dec. 4, 2020 — the highest death rate in the country at that time.",TRUE

As hospitals continued to be overwhelmed in 2020 by a surge in COVID-19 cases across the United States, false information surrounding the management of the disease and patients continued to circulate.
One post in particular, shared on our Facebook group, Snopes Tips, claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement alleging that “anyone who walks into the hospital is counted as a Covid case, no matter why they come to the hospital,” as the government pays the hospital extra money.

There are two parts to this claim: Firstly, that hospitals are inflating their COVID-19 numbers, and secondly, that the government is allocating more funds based on coronavirus cases.
Snopes covered the second part of the claim back in April. We learned that it was possible that Medicare was paying hospital fees for some COVID-19 cases, but Medicare stated that it does not make standard, one-size-fits-all payments to hospitals for patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses and placed on ventilators.
The CDC highlighted in a statement how the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES), the Paycheck Protection Program, and Health Care Enhancement Act provided $175 billion in relief funds to hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response:
In the first round of the High Impact Allocation, $12 billion was distributed to nearly 400 hospitals who provided inpatient care for 100 or more COVID-19 patients through April 10, 2020. $2 billion of these payments was distributed to these hospitals based on their Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments. In the second round of funding, $10 billion will be distributed to hospitals having over 161 COVID-19 admissions between January 1 and June 10, 2020.
For the first part of the claim, we looked through CDC statements and reports about people admitted to hospitals around the country and were unable to find a case where the CDC said that the hospital was inflating its COVID-19 case numbers in order to get more money. We reached out to the CDC, and the agency referred us to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but did not confirm whether it had ever made such a statement about hospitals counting everyone who enters as a COVID-19 case.
U.S. President Donald Trump promoted another version of this conspiracy theory at a rally in October, where he said hospitals were inflating the numbers of COVID-19 deaths, and was roundly debunked by news outlets and rejected in a statement by the American College of Emergency Physicians. 
To imply that emergency physicians would inflate the number of deaths from this pandemic to gain financially is offensive, especially as many are actually under unprecedented financial strain as they continue to bear the brunt of COVID-19. These baseless claims not only do a disservice to our health care heroes but promulgate the dangerous wave of misinformation which continues to hinder our nation’s efforts to get the pandemic under control and allow our nation to return to normalcy.
The dire situation in hospitals paints a very different picture, far-removed from claims that they are profiting financially from the pandemic. A New York Times report from Nov. 27, 2020, highlighted how surging coronavirus numbers were resulting in a crisis-level shortage of beds and staff around the country. In some cases, hospitals were facing shortages in protective equipment, forcing healthcare workers to buy their own. As of Dec. 3, 2020, hospitalizations from the virus topped 100,000 — an all-time high since the pandemic began. 
An April Washington Post report described how hospitals were also suffering from financial losses on account of their deferring or cancelling non-urgent surgeries to free up bed space for the pandemic, cutting off income, and forcing them to lay off workers. At the time, relief packages for hospitals were widely described as insufficient.
Hospital-reported data on COVID-19 patients have addressed a range of issues around the country. A July 2020 ProPublica report detailed how the Trump administration had told hospitals to stop reporting data to the CDC and instead report it to HHS. The move resulted in widespread confusion. While the number of infected patients was soaring nationally, for a period of time it was unclear how many were being treated in hospitals for COVID-19. A few states like Idaho and South Carolina experienced temporary information blackouts, and the COVID Tracking Project reported issues with its figures.
A Nov. 29, 2020, investigation by the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) magazine found the federal system for tracking COVID-19 patients was continuing to carry questionable data. HHS collected hospital patient data in two ways — through HHS Protect, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Their two sources of data on the usage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for COVID patients conflicted sharply in at least six states. HHS data also diverged sharply from state-supplied data, and showed that over the last two months, COVID-19 in-patient tally in 14 states was consistently lower than HHS Protect’s.
In at least 27 states, the tally was alternating between being lower and higher than HHS. And recently, in 16 states, the tallies grew closer. The over-arching conclusion for this analysis was that hospitals are going to be over-stressed in the upcoming months, with inaccurate information systems in place.
We have reached out to the HHS to learn more, and will update this post with more information.
Additionally, if the language of the claim is taken at face value, CDC guidance for hospitals references providing “necessary in-person clinical services for conditions other than COVID-19 in the safest way possible, minimizing disease transmission to patients […].” This leads to the conclusion that the CDC itself is not stating that hospitals are classifying everyone who walks in as a COVID-19 case.
While it is true that the government did provide relief funds in various forms for COVID-19 cases to hospitals in need of aid, little evidence exists that numbers were being inflated by hospitals for this reason. We thus rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",mostly-false

In late 2020, three major pharmaceutical companies announced promising results in early trials of their COVID-19 vaccine candidates, prompting widespread optimism about the availability of a safe and effective vaccine for the virus, perhaps even before the end of the year. 
On Dec. 2, 2020, the U.K. government gave emergency authorization for the distribution and application of the vaccine created by Pfizer and a smaller German company called BioNTech. The distribution was scheduled to start during the week of Dec. 7. 
BioNTech was founded by Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, two immunologists and cancer researchers who also happen to be a married couple. Their striking personal story became the focus of news coverage in late 2020, and their achievements were described by some as an “immigrant success story” — Sahin was born in Turkey and immigrated to German with his family at the age of 4, while Türeci was born in Germany to a Turkish immigrant father. 
In November and December 2020, social media users enthusiastically shared an old photograph of what they said was Sahin’s family, claiming that “the boy in the yellow t-shirt” would later go on to lead the team that created the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine:

In one instance, another user claimed the photograph showed a family of Romanian immigrants. 
These widely shared posts were misleading. Sahin and his family did immigrate to Germany from Turkey when he was a young child. But Sahin’s family is not shown in the photograph in question, and Sahin is not the boy in the yellow T-shirt. The widely shared tweet that referred to a Romanian family in Germany was entirely inaccurate. 
Analysis
As originally reported by the Turkish fact-checking website Teyit, the picture in question was taken by the German photographer Candida Höfer. It was featured in a 2016 collection of Höfer’s photographs, entitled “Türken in Deutschland” (“Turks in Germany”). 

Another of Höfer’s photographs shows just the mother and father from the family in question:

In August 2020, DiasporaTürk — an online community dedicated to collecting stories and material relating to Turkish emigrés in Europe in the second half of the 20th century — profiled the family featured in Höfer’s photographs. The photograph of the family (including the children) was dated to 1975 and apparently taken in Düsseldorf. 
Although the date next to photographs of the family sometimes appears online as 1979, that is the year in which Höfer first exhibited the collection, rather than the year in which those particular photographs were taken. 
According to DiasporaTürk, one of the grandsons of the couple from the photograph contacted them and filled in the blanks about the family’s story, explaining that the father had moved to Germany from Aksaray, Turkey, in 1965, and the rest of the family joined him later. In 1975 they moved to Düsseldorf, and the photograph in question was taken within a week of their moving into their new home. Rather than becoming a cancer researcher, the boy in the yellow T-shirt became a lathe setter. 
The date of the photograph makes any purported connection to Sahin somewhat implausible. We have not yet been able to independently verify Sahin’s precise date of birth (Wikipedia states variously he was born on Sept. 19 or Sept. 29, 1965) but an August 2016 news article gave his age as 50, and The New York Times reported in November 2020 that he was 55 years old. 
As such, Sahin would have been either 9 or 10 years old in 1975, when Höfer’s photograph of a Turkish family in Düsseldorf was taken. It’s possible the boy in the yellow shirt was that old, at that time, but it’s unlikely. 
Furthermore, as Teyit correctly pointed out, The New York Times noted in its profile of Sahin and Türeci that Sahin had left the city of Iskenderun, Turkey, whereas the family from the photograph emigrated from Aksaray, some 170 miles away. 
Some social media posts and online articles including the photograph of the family described them specifically as Turkish Muslim immigrants. We have not yet been able to determine Sahin’s person religious convictions, if any, so this element of the narrative surrounding both the photograph, and Sahin’s personal background, remains unclear. In November 2019, Sahin was the recipient of a Mustafa Prize, an Iranian-administered award for scientists in the Islamic world.
Eligible nominees must either be professed Muslims from anywhere in the world, or scientists of any religious persuasion from one of 57 Muslim-majority nations (including Sahin’s native Turkey). As a result, Sahin’s personal religious convictions cannot be deduced from his winning a Mustafa prize in 2019.
Although the family shown in the photograph is not Sahin’s, and the boy in the yellow shirt is not him, the milieu it depicted may well have been similar to the one in which Sahin grew up. According to multiple reports, Sahin’s father — like the father of the “boy in the yellow t-shirt” — immigrated to Germany as a gastarbeiter (“guest worker”) in a Ford factory in Cologne. Both men originally arrived by themselves, before their respective families later joined them. 
The purpose of the guest-worker programs was to bring an influx of skilled labor into Germany in order to revive the German economy in the 1960s and 1970s. Workers were originally intended to stay for only two years, before returning to their countries of origin, but the rules were later changed and allowed for family reunification in Germany.
So in the case of Sahin and the boy in the yellow shirt, their families’ journey in German society began under the same legal mechanisms, and in similarly modest circumstances.",FALSE
6709.0,"A Facebook post is correct in saying N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks can be dangerous and/or ineffective in protecting against the spread of COVID-19 based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines.","Are These Claims About the Effectiveness of Face Masks True?
A widely shared Facebook post from June 2020, purportedly citing the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offered numerous claims but little evidence.
Another day, another viral claim about the effectiveness (or not) of face masks amidst the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of 2020. A popular Facebook post that had been copied and pasted numerous times in June repeated spurious but familiar claims about masks, this time selectively citing U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) recommendations:

The lengthy post focused on three different types of protective masks: N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks. We tackle assertions about each one below. 
N95 Masks
According to this post your unfiltered, potentially infectious breath could harm others if you are breathing through an N95 respirator.
N95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. That means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight out without filtration. They don’t filter the air on the way out. They don’t need to.
Conclusion: if you’re in Stewart’s and the guy with Covid has N95 mask his covid breath is unfiltered being exhaled into Stewart’s (because it was designed for already contaminated environments, it’s not filtering your air on the way out)
This is mostly true, except it only applies to N95 respirators with valves. Such masks were designed for construction/factory workers or miners, to keep out dust and other particles, but not to prevent infectious particles from leaving the mask. When the wearer inhales, the one-way valve closes so pathogens can’t get through, but when the user exhales, the valve opens. In May, the San Francisco Department of Public Health tweeted that N95 masks with valves in the front weren’t safe and “may actually propel your germs further.”
Hospitals largely use N95 masks without valves for this reason, and in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. OSHA’s guidelines on N95s primarily focus on how they are meant “to prevent workers from inhaling small particles, including airborne transmissible or aerosolized infectious agents,” and should be required in workplaces where respirators are needed.
Surgical Masks
The Facebook post argues that wearing a surgical mask makes you a “walking virus dispenser,” as follows:
Surgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE environments. The amount of particles and contaminants in the outside and indoor environments where people are CLOGG these masks very Very quickly. The moisture from your breath combined with the clogged mask will render it “useless” IF you come in contact with Covid and your mask traps it You become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They should be changed or thrown out every “20-30 minutes in a non sterile environment”
OSHA guidelines seem to contradict some of these claims, arguing that surgical masks protect workers “against [potentially infectious] splashes and sprays,” and also “contain” the wearer’s respiratory droplets to protect others. OSHA says these masks should be placed on sick individuals to prevent transmission via droplets. Surgical masks do, however, offer ineffective protection from transmission via airborne particles due to their loose fit. While the post argues that such masks should be thrown out every 20-30 minutes, OSHA simply recommends that they “should be properly disposed of after use.”
Cloth Masks
The Facebook post’s claims about cloth masks are mostly false and have been debunked by Snopes before. The author claims:
Cloth masks: today three people pointed to their masks as the walked by me entering Lowe’s. They said “ya gotta wear your mask BRO” I said very clearly “those masks don’t work bro, in fact they MAKE you sicker” the “pshh’d” me.
By now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter anything … ALL of them offer NO FILTERING whatsoever. As you exhale you are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide. Cloth masks trap this carbon dioxide the best. It actually risks health. The moisture caught in these masks can become mildew ridden over night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all symptoms of a micro-mold in your mask.
OSHA guidelines already state that cloth masks are ineffective filters against airborne particles. They are worn to protect other people from risk of infection via respiratory droplets. People wearing them are in little to no danger of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide. The post points out the danger of dirty masks, which is why both OSHA and CDC recommend washing cloth masks after use.
OSHA also “generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work,” contradicting the argument of this entire post. 
Finally, the author of the post claimed to be “OSHA 10&30 certified,” which refers to OSHA’s 10-hour and 30-hour training modules about common health and safety hazards in the workplace. We reached out to OSHA, and a representative told us that these courses “do not include COVID-19 topics,” nor does OSHA “certify” trainers.
In sum, the varied claims in this viral post (with their dubious origins) for the most part misrepresented information provided by OSHA. Scientific wisdom argues that wearing a mask is more effective than doing nothing, and, combined with social distancing and other safety measures, offers protection not only to the wearer but to others. Given this post’s combination of only a few correct facts and largely incorrect conclusions, we rate its various claims as “Mostly False.”",mostly-false

A study published in November 2020 may have shifted the timeline of the U.S. arrival of the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. According to research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Red Cross, SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in American populations as early as December 2019.
The findings were published on Nov. 30 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, and were subsequently reported on by a number of reputable media publications. Results sparked uncertainty by some social media users who proposed that they had perhaps been infected by the novel coronavirus before U.S. health officials had recognized it was present in U.S. residents.

While it is true that researchers found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in U.S. blood supplies as early as Dec. 13, 2019, important caveats should be noted, including that the presence of the virus in the U.S. at the time does not mean it was spreading at the community level. Snopes readers asked our team to dive into the study and its limitations. But first, some background on the pandemic.
A Brief History of the Coronavirus Pandemic
SARS-CoV-2 was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) was first notified of a cluster of pneumonia-like cases on Dec. 31. In the weeks that followed, the virus spread across the planet. Later, it was confirmed that a patient was hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan on Dec. 1, 2019. COVID-19 infection was first identified in the U.S. on Jan. 19, 2020, when a person returned from China, but tracing indicates there were at least two other cases in the country by Jan. 14.
Research conducted by the CDC and American Red Cross suggested that the virus had been initiated into the U.S earlier than thought, but the widespread transmission was not likely until February.
How the Red Cross Study Was Conducted
In order to determine more specifically when SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in the U.S., scientists conducted serological testing of 7,398 routine unidentified blood samples collected by the Red Cross between Dec. 13, 2019, and Jan. 17, 2020, taken from donors in nine states. Serologic testing — essentially an antibody test — confirmed the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in order to estimate when the virus was introduced into a population and estimate how many people had already been infected with the virus.
“An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections,” wrote the agency. “Antibodies are typically detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. Antibody test results are especially important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms.”

What the Researchers Found
In part, serologic testing may employ immunological memory, which is the ability of the immune system to respond quickly and effectively to pathogens that it had been exposed to previously.
Antibodies that reacted to the virus were found in about 1.1% of blood samples collected in all nine states — or just 84 individuals. But when it was present varies. Samples indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was present in California, Oregon, and Washington as early as Dec. 13 to 16, 2019 and in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin between Dec. 30, 2019, and Jan. 17, 2020. But because the percentage of infected overall blood samples was very low, it is thought that the virus was not widespread at that time.
“The presence of these serum antibodies indicate that isolated SARS-CoV-2 infections may have occurred in the western portion of the United States earlier than previously recognized or that a small portion of the population may have pre-existing antibodies that bind SARS-CoV-2,” the study authors wrote.
Important Study Limitations to Note
While the findings suggested that the virus may have been present in the U.S. much earlier than previously believed, it is not possible to know whether the infection was spread through the community or associated with travel.
“It is not possible to determine whether the potential SARS-CoV-2 infections suggested by this study may have been community or travel-associated,” said Dr. Susan Stramer, vice president of Scientific Affairs at the American Red Cross, in a news release. “A previous survey of blood donors, conducted to help understand travel practices, determined that less than 3% of respondents reported travel outside of the U.S. within the 28 days prior to donation, and of those reporting travel, only 5% traveled to Asia.
Though the tests were looking for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies specifically, there are seven known types of other coronaviruses that have some similarities, so it is possible a level of cross-reactivity occurred. According to the Virginia Department of Health, most people become infected with coronaviruses that cause the common cold at some point during their lives. And because the blood samples were anonymous to researchers, none could be considered “true positives” — this can only be determined from a person who had received a positive molecular diagnostic test.
Furthermore, donations may also not represent all blood donors or donations in these states, so they cannot be used to generalize all blood donors during the dates in the report and cannot make an inference on national or state levels of infection rates during the study period.
What Happens Next
In closing, the study authors said that they will continue to work with federal and non-governmental partners to conduct surveillance using blood donations and test clinical lab samples specific to SARS-CoV-2 to characterize the spread of infection across the U.S.

In November 2020, as news broke that a vaccination for COVID-19 was being prepared for distribution, a rumor started circulating on social media that the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline owned a laboratory in Wuhan, China — the Wuhan Institute of Virology — where conspiracy theorists falsely maintain the COVID-19 pandemic originated. 
This rumor, which reads like a game of six-degrees of separation, attempts to trace a line from GlaxoSmithKline, to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, to billionaire philanthropist and frequent right-wing boogeyman George Soros, and, in some iterations of this rumor, to Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.
Here’s one version of the rumor that was posted to Twitter:

This tweet reads: “The Chinese biological laboratory in Wuhan is owned by Glaxo! Who, by cnance [sic], owns Pfizer! (the one who produces the vaccine!) Which, by chance, is managed by Black Rock finances. Who, by chance, manages the finances of the Open Foundation Company (SOROS FOUNDATION)!”
This nonsensical game of connect the dots starts with a false assertion. The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology — a research lab in China that has been the center of conspiracy theories since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic — is operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and is funded, in large part, by the Chinese government. It is not owned by GlaxoSmithKline or any other private company.
“Over the past 40 years, half of its income has come directly from central-government investment; the rest has been from competitive funding or technology transfer. CAS could not develop without the funding and support of the central government.”
It’s also false to say that GlaxoSmithKline owns the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. 
While these two companies share some common interests — in 2018, they announced a joint venture that combined their consumer health businesses — they remain two distinct companies. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time:
Pfizer Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC plan to combine their consumer health-care units and eventually spin off the joint venture, creating the world’s largest seller of drugstore staples like Advil and Sensodyne toothpaste.
The deal, announced Wednesday, will free up both companies to concentrate on prescription medicines, which tend to be more profitable if also higher risk.
The joint venture represents an unexpected conclusion to a yearlong process by Pfizer to shed its consumer business, as it and other pharmaceutical companies focus on higher-margin prescription drugs. While Glaxo has shared that focus, the British drugmaker had remained committed to its consumer business, which its chief executive led before her promotion to the top job last year.
This joint venture, however, did not involve one company buying the other. 
This rumor appears to have been created with the intent of stirring up confusion and skepticism over the COVID-19 vaccine by connecting pharmaceutical companies to a laboratory in Wuhan, China. GlaxoSmithKline, however, does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Furthermore, claims that COVID-19 was “manufactured,” or that it “escaped from” this Chinese lab, are nothing more than baseless conspiracy theories.",FALSE

During these three key periods, the brain undergoes dynamic changes, which could make the cognitive organ more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol.
Drinking alcohol at a moderate level may have a particularly damaging effect on the brain during three key life stages, according to a scientific review published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on Dec. 4, 2020.

A closer look at how alcohol affects your brain at three key stages in life: https://t.co/cY0qsRqxyS
— Alcohol Health Alliance UK (@UK_AHA) December 8, 2020

In the days following the study publication, a number of media outlets reported on the findings. 
Research does show the brain will go through three key stages of dynamic change throughout life, making the cognitive organ particularly sensitive to the effects of moderate alcohol consumption during gestation, in later adolescence, and again in later adulthood. What is unknown is how other factors may negatively influence the brain in addition to age, such as how many drinks are consumed and at what frequency.
Aside from the hazy, inhibition-free behavioral changes that alcohol may produce, science suggests that consuming alcohol may affect the brain in a number of ways, from memory loss and a loss of attention span to diminished gray matter in the brain.
Researchers in Australia and the United Kingdom conducted a review of existing literature on the effects of alcohol and brain development. The findings are published as an editorial in the BMJ, which differs from a study in that it is a fact-based article centered around peer-reviewed research but is not new research in and of itself. Rather, the review summarized other published scientific literature that explored the potentially damaging effects of alcohol on the brain. 
“From fetal development to later life, the human brain goes through several periods of dynamic change,” wrote the researchers. “Each of these changes in neurocircuitry could increase sensitivity to the effects of environmental exposures such as alcohol.”
During these three key periods, the brain undergoes dynamic changes, which we explore below.
Gestation: From Conception to Birth
While still in the womb, the brain of the fetus develops as do other parts of the body — particularly during the third trimester when it exhibits a rapid development of neurons and wiring. The prenatal period is characterized by extensive production, migration, and differentiation of neurons.
Heavy alcohol use during pregnancy has been linked to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which is associated with widespread reductions in brain volume and cognitive impairment. Even low or moderate consumption may influence psychological and behavioral outcomes
Later Adolescence: 15 to 19 Years
An estimated one-in-five teens in Europe and other high-income countries report binge drinking at least on occasion. In their review, the researchers noted that drinking between the ages of 15 and 19 is associated with reduced brain volume, poorer white matter development critical to brain function, and some deficits in the range of cognitive abilities.
In later adolescence, for example, the frontal cortex is responsible for reasoning and is still developing, changing, and maturing. Alcohol consumption may inhibit development as well as synaptic pruning, a process by which the brain eliminates unnecessary connections and increases efficiencies between necessary ones.
Older Adulthood: Over the Age of 65
Older people begin to experience brain atrophy with the brain shrinking in volume, particularly in the frontal cortex. This decrease accelerates after the age of 65 and is largely driven by decreases in neuron size and reduction in important synapses, which could play a role in the development and acceleration of dementia. Even moderate drinking has been shown to result in a small but significant loss of brain volume, but further research is needed to determine exactly what these structural changes mean.
However, the review is not without limitations. Notably, the review did not conduct new, independently peer-reviewed research as determined by the scientific method. Rather, the authors analyzed and summarized key findings from the associated scientific literature. 
“The evidence for the adverse effects of alcohol on brain health is compelling, but it is limited by the observational nature of the analyses,” noted the authors. “These findings require further replication, with a focus on more rigorous causal modeling.”  In other words, more experimental research in a controlled setting is needed to understand how alcohol affects the brain at these ages.
Regardless, the authors called for an integrated approach to reduce the potential harm from alcohol across all age groups, particularly as many nations are seeing an increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the researchers called for a broader perspective on brain health to help reduce alcohol use and misuse at all ages, which they note could reduce the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome, cognitive development issues in adolescence, and dementia in later life.
“Population-based interventions such as guidelines on low-risk drinking, alcohol pricing policies, and lower drunk driving limits need to be accompanied by the development of training and care pathways that consider the human brain at risk throughout life,” concluded study author Louise Mewton in a news release.",mostly-true

In December 2020, amid a renewed surge in new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States, many thousands of internet users shared a list that purported to put the devastating impact of fatalities from the pandemic into stark historical context. 
On Dec. 8, Twitter user @Sundae_Gurl posted a list of the eight “Deadliest Days in American History,” with four of the eight purportedly taking place during the first week of December 2020 (image above).
Memes that included the same content and figures were widely promoted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The list began to be shared during the week of Dec. 7, 2020, so the mentions of “last Tuesday”, “last Wednesday”, “last Thursday” and “last Friday” were clearly a reference to Dec. 1 through Dec. 4, 2020. Anyone viewing the list, with the same figures, from Dec. 14 onwards, should bear that in mind. 
The broader point made by those promoting the meme was thoroughly sound. The COVID-19 pandemic has indeed resulted in daily death totals in the United States that are remarkably high by historical standards, and have on several occasions exceeded the number of fatalities from the attacks on Pearl Harbor, for example.
However, the ranking omitted some natural disasters whose fatalities were more numerous than even the highest daily tolls from COVID-19, as of Dec. 9, 2020. Furthermore, if official daily tallies were recorded of deaths during the peak of the 1918 influenza pandemic, those figures would also exceed the daily fatality figures from COVID-19.  
Analysis
Interpretation 
The first, obvious problem with the list is that it does not take into account the thousands of deaths, from various causes, that take place as a matter of course every day in the United States.
For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded more than 2.8 million deaths in 2018, the most recent year for which official figures are available. That’s an average of 7,779 per day — a higher death toll than almost all of the days listed in the meme. For perspective, in 2018 the CDC recorded 655,381 deaths from heart disease alone — an average of 1,796 deaths per day from that single cause. 
Official figures are not systematically available for all deaths, from all causes, on a day-to-day basis, so a definitive ranking of the “deadliest days in American history” — understood as the days on which the highest number of deaths, from all causes, were attributable — is not possible. 
However, given that the deaths listed for Dec. 1 through Dec. 4, 2020, relate exclusively to COVID-19, and the other four days on the list relate exclusively to discrete events, like the Battle of Antietam or the Galveston hurricane, it’s reasonable to conclude that the list is intended as a ranking of the highest death tolls from a specific event or cause that took place on a single day. 
Indeed, Twitter user @Sundae_Gurl — whose Dec. 8 tweet was the most widely shared instance of the list that we found — stipulated this very disclaimer, writing “It’s excess deaths attributable to a specific reason.”
For those reasons, we will assess the list on that basis — as a ranking of the highest death tolls from a specific event or cause on a particular day — while noting that much of the confusion and argument surrounding the meme could have been avoided if that disclaimer had been included in the ranking itself in the first place. 
Methodology
Another brief clarification is required. In some cases, deaths attributable to an event that took place on a specific day are not recorded until after that day, or do not take place until after the day itself. For example, in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the New York Medical Examiner’s office continued to certify a small number of deaths as homicides from the attacks, even though the victims did not die on the day itself, but later died from illnesses or injuries directly attributable to the attacks, or in cases where the victim’s remains were never identified but circumstantial evidence yielded a conclusion that they had died on 9/11. 
Fatalities from military battles and natural disasters often follow a similar pattern — a number of deaths either don’t take place until after the event itself, or aren’t recorded until afterwards, but they are undeniably caused by that specific event on the specific day in question. In other words, the meme counts deaths from 9/11, rather than on 9/11; deaths from the attack on Pearl Harbor, rather than deaths during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and so on.
Ranking
The list shared widely in December 2020 contained some notable omissions and questionable figures, and the inclusion of likely daily death totals from the peak of the 1918 influenza pandemic would eclipse those resulting from COVID-19 between Dec. 1 and Dec. 4, 2020, and see them relegated from the “Top 8”.
Nonetheless, the daily death tolls from COVID-19 have indeed been very high by historical standards. It is of particular symbolic significance that several days in 2020, including during the first week of December, saw more deaths from COVID-19 than the 2,403 American deaths that resulted from the attacks on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941 — a milestone event in modern American history, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt dubbed “a date which will live in infamy.”
Notable mass-fatality events omitted from the list include the San Ciriaco hurricane, which killed a reported 3,369 people in Puerto Rico, after it made landfall there on Aug. 8, 1899; and the Lake Okeechobee hurricane, which killed an estimated 2,500-3,000 people as it swept through parts of Florida on Sept. 16, 1928. 
Historically, the death toll from the San Francisco earthquake on April 18, 1906, had been set in the hundreds, but decades of research led by former city archivist Gladys Hansen revealed more than 3,400 deaths directly attributable to the disaster, as well as a political cover-up of those fatalities. In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors formally voted to record a new official death count in accordance with Hansen’s research. 
Finally, the 1918 flu pandemic caused hundreds of thousands of fatalities throughout the United States. Daily death totals are not available, but the U.S. Census Bureau recorded all deaths from influenza and pneumonia as attributable to “pandemic mortality” and reported (page 27) that 477,467 such deaths had taken place in the U.S. in 1918. Of those, 79.8 % took place in “the last four months of the year” — Sept. 1 through Dec. 31, 1918. 
That’s 381,019 deaths from the flu pandemic in just 122 days, an average of 3,123 per day. Given that that figure is only an average, it is certain that at least a few days during the autumn of 1918 saw death tolls from the flu pandemic comfortably in excess of 3,000, which would cause the four days from early December 2020 to be further relegated in the rankings of “The Deadliest Days in American History.”",mixture

Photograph supposedly depicts a breast rash caused by 'South American larvae'?
Examples: 

[Collected via e-mail, 2003]
After anthropologist Susan McKinley came back home from an expedition in South America, she noticed a very strange rash on her left breast. Nobody knew what it was and she quickly dismissed it believing that the sores would leave in time.
Upon her return she decided to see a doctor after she started developing intense pains. The doctor, not knowing the exact severity of the case, gave her antibiotics and special creams. As time elapsed the pain did not subside and her left breast became more inflamed and started to bleed. She decided to bandage her sores however as Susan’s pain grew more intense she decided to seek help from a more certified doctor.
Dr. Lynch could not diagnose the infection and told Susan to seek the aid of one of his colleagues who specialized in dermatology whom was sadly on vacation.  She waited for two weeks and finally was able to reach the dermatologist. Sadly, a life changing event was about to unfold during her appointment.

To Miss McKinley’s surprise, after she removed the bandages, they found larva growing and squirming within the pores and sores of her breast.  Sometimes these wicked creatures would all together simultaneously move around into different crevices.  What she didn’t know was that the holes were in fact, deeper than she had originally thought for these larvae were feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom. The holes were 5 cm deep. She was operated on and the larva was removed from her breast. Therefore always take a slight rash serious and have the eggs removed before it is to late. Cheers and may the creatures leave you in peace.

Variations:   In June 2014 a similar fabricated image was used in conjunction with a survey scam that lured users with a link headed “You Will Not Use Head & Shoulders Shampoo After Watching This Video.”
Origins:   This item is another example of a common Internet phenomenon: Someone makes an image available on-line, the picture begins to circulate through e-mail forwards, the original 
attribution or explanation for the image gets lost along the way (or was never provided), people begin to make up stories to explain the origin of the now-sourceless picture, and those fabricated explanations become attached to the image as it continues to circulate.   We’ve seen this phenomenon before in the maggot photographs (disturbing image warning), only in this case it isn’t just the explanation that’s fabricated; the image is a phony one created through digital manipulation as well. 
This image appeared on the Internet back in June 2003 (on a web site with a collection of other manipulated photographs); at that time it carried no explanation at all and was soon attributed by others to some new type of “body modification.”  Not until a couple of months later did it pick up the story about an anthropologist named “Susan McKinley” who returned from a South American expedition to notice a “very strange rash” on her breast caused by “larvae” which were “feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom.”  No known medical condition causes a result like the one depicted here, and the breast tissue around the supposed “larvae infestation” (larvae of what?) is too healthy (no redness, inflammation, or necrosis) to be believable.  This image appears to be the product of the melding of a photograph of a woman’s breast and a picture of something similar to a lotus seed pod:










In 2005 someone combined the picture and text quoted in the “Example” box above with an existing video clip that seemingly shows maggot-like creatures being removed by forceps from a woman’s infected breast, and in November 2005 we began seeing versions that claimed the patient had developed her condition due to the flooding of New Orleans caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005


My aunt, Head Nurse at Tulane Memorial hospital in New Orleans Louisiana
sent me this email.  The attached video is that of a female patient who,
due to the flooding of her home wore the same clothes for days.  The
contamination in the water was so bad she first broke out with a rash on
her breast and then she had a lump on her breast and she popped it and
puss excreted from the lump.  After treating it herself for days she
finally went to seek medical attention and when she did they found
serious infection!  They later sedated the patient and found that these
insects were within the fatty tissues of her breast and within the milk
producing glands (sorry not a TRUE medic), she is also 3 months
pregnant! And to think, we though Rita was bad on us!  If you pay
attention you can see them moving in and out, gross, but one of the
issues they are now dealing with in New Orleans with patients.


This is a genuine video, but it has no connection to Hurricane Katrina.   It shows the treatment of a Nigerian patient with breast lesions and multiple sinuses containing Tumbu fly larvae.  (Fourteen separate larvae were eventually extracted from the breast.)  The authors of a 2004 medical journal article on the case noted at the time that only “one case has been reported in the English literature.”

In 2006, someone combined the following text with a series of photographs of patients experiencing what look like severe rashes, infections, and necrosis of the upper chest and breasts.  The specific origins of these photos are unknown to us, but they likely depict the advanced stages of breast cancer.

7677.0,mRNA vaccines are capable of altering or damaging human DNA.,"No, mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not ‘Alter Your DNA’
A viral bit of copypasta purporting to have been authored by Robert F. Kennedy Jr makes a series of erroneous claims about the science underlying two promising vaccines.
In mid-November, a lengthy bit of viral and repeatedly copied-and-pasted-text spread across various social media platforms and fringe conspiracy websites. The post, whatever platform it finds itself on, is typically titled “Covid vaccine should be avoided at all cost,” and is often described as a message from anti-vaccine crusader Robert F. Kennedy Jr. For several reasons discussed in the second portion of this piece, it is unlikely that Kennedy actually authored the text in the post, though some of it appears to be lifted from items he has attached his name to.
The most viral, and also most dangerous, aspect of this prolific bit of copypasta is the scientifically baseless assertion that mRNA vaccines such as the COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna can “alter” human DNA:
COVID Vaccine Should Be Avoided At All Cost
For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called last generation mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which represents the genetic manipulation, something that was already forbidden and until then considered criminal.
This intervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food, which is also highly controversial. Even if the media and politicians currently trivialize the problem and even stupidly call for a new type of vaccine to return to normality, this vaccination is problematic in terms of health, morality and ethics, and also in terms of genetic damage that, unlike the damage caused by previous vaccines, will be irreversible and irreparable. […]
The scientific word for this alleged alteration is insertional mutagenesis. Since well before it became famous as a potential COVID-19 vaccine, one of the most frequently touted benefits of this form of vaccine has been its inability to perform such an alteration.
In this post, we first provide a scientific explanation for why the mRNA vaccines in development (or currently in limited use) are incapable of insertional mutagenesis, and as such do not alter human DNA or damage it in any way. After this, we provide an overview of other claims in the viral post and address myriad red flags it should raise for anyone seriously interested in factual, accurate information.
mRNA Vaccines Cannot Alter or Damage Human Genes
The Pfizer vaccine, whose use was endorsed by an FDA expert panel on Dec. 10, 2020, and the Moderna vaccine, which is a leading contender in the race as well, are both known as mRNA vaccines. This pandemic will initiate this class of drugs’ first widespread human use. The “avoided at all cost” post makes the false assertion that “mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which represents the genetic manipulation.” This is not how the vaccine works, but to understand why, we first need to review the basics of how cells and the genetic material they contain work.
A cell contains a nucleus, which is separated from the rest of the cell by a membrane known as the nuclear envelope and several organelles (cellular substructures) floating around in the non-nucleus part of the cell, a region known as the cytoplasm. An organism’s primary genetic material is a series of DNA molecules known as chromosomes that are found in the nucleus. The code contained in these chromosomes is what is passed onto new cells when it makes a copy of itself. Because an alteration to nuclear DNA would be passed down as the cell replicates, it is this specific genetic material that would need to be altered for something to constitute a genetic manipulation of human DNA.
DNA, among other things, gives instructions to the rest of the cell on what proteins to build. To make a long story short, these instructions are sent from the nucleus of the cell in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA), which travels through the cell’s cytoplasm into an organelle called the ribosome. You can think of the ribosome as a protein-creating factory, the mRNA as the work order sent to the factory, and the nuclear DNA as a complete catalog of potential things that can be created at the ribosome protein factory.
The way mRNA vaccines work, to follow this analogy even further, is by sending a mRNA “work order” to a cell’s ribosome that did not originate from that cell’s nucleus but, instead, comes from engineered mRNA that makes its way into a cell’s cytoplasm via injection into body tissue. In the case of the two COVID-19 vaccines, the work order being sent to these cells is for the creation of proteins that form the spikes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Once cells in the body produce these proteins, their presence trains the immune system to recognize and attack them. As these spikes provide the primary method of entry for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, training one’s body to attack them is the proposed mechanism of immunity imparted by these vaccines. 
But sending mRNA into the cytoplasm of a cell is no minor task, as so-called “naked” nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) rapidly degrade in the human body when not in the safe harbor of a cell. Both Pfizer and Moderna have solved this problem by wrapping their mRNA in a series of lipids that provide two benefits: cell-like protection for its journey and an ability to exchange mRNA across the outer wall of a cell once it reaches its destination. While this delivery method is capable of transferring mRNA into the outer cytoplasm portion of a cell, it is chemically and physically impossible for it to deliver mRNA across the nuclear envelope into the nucleus of a cell.
In other words, mRNA vaccines bypass entirely the part of the cell apparatus that would need to be modified for anything to be considered human genetic modification. Further, the mRNA injected into the body is incapable of replication — it’s a one-time work order, not a contract, to take the metaphor (probably) too far. Because these lipid-protected mRNA molecules are incapable of entering a cell’s nucleus, they are incapable of altering human DNA. It’s as simple as that.
Kennedy Authorship and Other Red Flags
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a vocal opponent of vaccination for over a decade, and he has aggressively pushed the discredited link between vaccination and autism. His analysis is frequently flawed and his claims have been debunked on this website several times.
There are certain aspects of the “avoided at all cost” post that may have their origin in statements made by Kennedy, but it is unlikely he wrote this post. We are unaware, for example, of any time Kennedy has endorsed the use of bleaching agent chlorine dioxide as a cure for COVID-19 — a dangerous assertion that seems too extreme even for Kennedy, but is prominently mentioned in the post. The assertion that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab (it was not) so that it could be used as an “excuse to restrict freedoms, to change the current economic system to a more oppressive / enslaving, scary, blind flock obedience” does not sound like Kennedy writing either. We reached out to a representative of Kennedy about his purported authorship of the post, but did not receive a response.
Kennedy may well have inspired aspects of the viral copypasta, however. Kennedy, for example, has stated (falsely, as we already showed), that mRNA vaccines “function by altering DNA expression.” A paragraph in the viral post that suggests that “three of the 15 human guinea pigs” had a severe adverse reaction in a trial of the Moderna vaccine appears to be lifted from a May 2020 post Kennedy authored on the website of his organization Children’s Health Defense. That article reported on the results of Moderna’s phase I clinical trial.  Information sourced from a phase three trial released in November 2020, which included data from over 30,000 participants, tells a more complete picture:
The safety profile of the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273 was previously described on November 16. A continuous review of safety data is ongoing and no new serious safety concerns have been identified by the Company. Based on prior analysis, the most common solicited adverse reactions included injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and erythema/redness at the injection site. Solicited adverse reactions increased in frequency and severity in the mRNA-1273 group after the second dose.
Another glaring red flag in the viral post is the invocation of a doctor named Wolfgang Wodarg, an “experienced doctor” who is reported to have said that the vaccine (unclear which one) “should be FORBIDDEN, because it is genetic manipulation.” Wolfgang Wodarg does have a medical background, but he is more well-known as a German politician. More importantly, he has a dismal track record when it comes to being right about anything that has to do with COVID-19. Back in March 2020, he was one of the leading COVID-19 pandemic denialists, literally arguing that the pandemic did not exist and was just a data classification artifact. Now he makes faulty claims about genetic manipulation stemming from vaccination. He certainly wasn’t right in March and he is not right now, either. 
Regardless of who authored this hodgepodge of misinformation, though, it is representative of some of the dangerous and scientifically unbacked talking points being pushed by the anti-vaccine movement presently. Most importantly, its central claim that irreversible genetic manipulation of human DNA is a plausible risk from mRNA vaccines is categorically false. The claim suffers from a profound lack of understanding regarding the actual mechanics of the treatment.",FALSE

In December 2020, as daily nationwide death tolls from COVID-19 reached new peaks, social media users shared a photograph that appeared to provide a stark illustration of the emotional devastation wrought by the virus. 
On Dec. 3, Arkansas family care doctor Ken Starnes posted a photograph that showed a room full of iPads attached to tripods. He described it in the following way:
These are iPad stations being prepared for virtual ICU end of life visits by a palliative care doc I know. Jesus.

Starnes’ tweet was shared tens of thousands of times on Twitter and further promoted on Facebook.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, healthcare professionals across the country have documented the use of video conferencing technology to allow COVID-19 patients to speak to their loved ones, who are typically barred from in-person visits due to hospital policies. In cases where a patient’s condition is worsening, many have ultimately said their final goodbyes to loved ones through the medium of Zoom, Skype or FaceTime calls.
As CNN reported on Dec. 6:
Some hospitals are stocking enough iPads to rival a modest Apple store. But the reason for this reflects a grim reality: They’re being used to connect Covid-19 patients with their families — sometimes, for the last conversation they’ll ever have. When Dr. Mark Shapiro posted about a patient saying goodbye to his family via an iPad, he wanted to communicate to others the severity of this pandemic.
“As the ICU (intensive care unit) team makes ready, there’s a key step we mustn’t forget,” Shapiro, who is a hospitalist at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital in California, wrote on Twitter. “At first he [the patient] says ‘No,’ but we encourage him. The nurse brings in the iPad. With the last air in his shattered lungs, he says goodbye to his family. Over an internet connection.”
Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the thousands of patients coming in every day after contracting coronavirus. Across the US, there’s been a shortage of hospital supplies for medical staff and beds for patients. And the contagious nature of the illness has forced hospitals to limit, and often forbid, visitation rights to mitigate its spread. The latest solution has been the implementation of iPad stations and other virtual technology so patients can communicate with their friends and family — often, for the last time.
As a result, Starnes’ description of the viral photograph he posted appears eminently plausible, and we have found no specific evidence, and no background information, to suggest that he misrepresented what the photograph showed, or that someone else misrepresented its content to him.
However, we have been unable to verify its authenticity, nor corroborate the accuracy of his descriptions. Snopes sent Starnes a list of questions designed to help us verify the authenticity and provenance of the photograph, and to investigate whether his description of it was accurate. We did not receive a response. If we receive evidence that corroborates or undermines Starnes’ claims, we will update this fact check accordingly.",FALSE

The ""Sputnik V"" vaccine at issue here differs from the vaccines nearing approval in the United States.
On Dec. 9, 2020, news of an especially stringent no-drinking recommendation endorsed by a Russian health official went viral in the United States, with stories appearing in the New York Post, New York Daily News and local outlets across the country. These stories reference a Dec. 4 interview on Radio Komsomolskaya Pravda with Tatyana Golikova, Russia’s deputy prime minister for social policy, labour, health and pension provision. In the interview, she recommended that recipients of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine abstain from alcohol for two weeks before and 42 days after the first (of two) injections.
As has been widely reported, it is factual that Golikova made this recommendation, but health experts have criticized it as excessive. Alexander Gintsburg, the developer of the vaccine and the director of the research institute that invented it, went so far as to call it “fake news” on Twitter. “We’re not talking about a complete ban on alcohol,” Gintsburg tweeted, “moderate consumption is allowed.” He did, however, “advise refraining from alcohol for 3 days after each injection.”
The Sputnik V account also tweeted a still of Leonardo DiCaprio holding up a glass of champagne from the 2013 film adaptation of “The Great Gatsby”:

The Sputnik V vaccine differs substantially from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that are at, or nearing, the final stage of approval in the United States. The Russian vaccine consists of two injections of a modified human adenovirus (a common virus which typically causes mild colds). The virus portion of the vaccine is different in each injection, but both adenoviruses have added genes that allow them to create small samples of the spike protein found in SARS-CoV-2, theoretically training the body’s immune system to fight the virus. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. They also induce the creation of the spike proteins, but do so without the use of a modified virus.

Mandatory mask-wearing in public gradually became the law of the land in regions across the United States in 2020 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.

These cards were shared on California-based Facebook groups in June, around the same time the state issued an executive order requiring Californians to wear face masks in public. Snopes readers asked us if the cards were valid. We learned they were not.

I am exempt from any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public. Wearing a face mask posses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you … Denying access to your business/organization will be also reported to FTBA for further actions.
Presented like a business card, it mislabeled the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as singular “Disability” act, included the ADA information line‘s phone number, and claimed there would be steep fines for any violation.
In an announcement on ADA.gov, while not explicitly referencing the above card, the Department of Justice (DOJ) declared such postings or flyers on the internet that used its seal as fraudulent. The San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, California, reiterated this:




The Freedom to Breathe Agency (FTBA), according to its Facebook page, was previously known as the Anti-Mask Task Force, and described itself as a “movement of proud American citizens who are dedicated to protecting their freedom and liberty.” They would not be able to enforce any action against offenders because they are not connected to a government agency.
But the card’s fake credentials implied that able-bodied bearers could exploit legitimate ADA regulations meant to protect people with disabilities. Snopes fact-checked a similar story in May 2020, when we learned that the ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask regulations must accommodate individuals who cannot wear masks due to their health or a disability. 
Coinciding with claims made in the card’s text, in many parts of the U.S., people aren’t required to disclose their physical condition if a business asks for proof of disability. But able-bodied people who seek to exploit such protections would not be supported by the ADA if, for example, they tried to sue a business for refusing them entry. In our previous investigation, we reached out to numerous ADA centers across the country. The New England ADA Center, for instance, told us:
The ADA protects the privacy of people who have disabilities. People who lie about a medical condition and don’t have one, do not have rights under the ADA.
In sum, even though their arguments rely on existing protections for people with disabilities, such cards arguing that bearers can be exempted from wearing masks are totally fake. We thus rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",mostly-false
7684.0,"Margaret Keenan, the first recipient of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, was featured in a news report two months earlier, providing evidence of wrongdoing or deception.","Did First COVID-19 Vaccine Recipient Suspiciously Appear in News Report Months Earlier?
A right-wing social media activist saw evidence of conspiracy where there was none in photographs of Margaret Keenan from December 2020.
In December 2020, COVID-19 denialists, conspiracy theorists, and vaccine skeptics reacted in predictable fashion to news reports about the distribution of the first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine doses in the United Kingdom on Dec. 8, 2020.
Later that day, self-described conservative activist Mindy Robinson suggested misdeeds or deception were at work in the appearance of 90-year-old Margaret Keenan as the first person in the world to receive the vaccine since, according to Robinson, Keenan had appeared in a CNN report from two months earlier, suspiciously dressed in the exact same outfit.
On Twitter, Robinson posted a screenshot from a Dec. 8 BBC News report that showed Keenan being attended to by a healthcare worker, along with the headline “Covid-19 Vaccine: First Person Receives Pfizer Jab in UK” alongside another screenshot taken from an Oct. 22 CNN article, which at first glance also appeared to be illustrated with a photograph of Keenan receiving a vaccination. 
Robinson wrote:
Excuse me, but how is the exact same person who’s the “first to get vaccinated” today…also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October? [Thinking face emoji] Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true?

In reality, there was no deception, subterfuge, or conspiracy at work behind either the Dec. 8 BBC story, or the Oct. 22 CNN story. Keenan definitively did not appear in the earlier report, and Robinson hadn’t ingeniously caught a shadowy cabal attempting to usher in a New World Order by secretly microchipping vaccine patients, or staging the vaccination campaign, or whatever specific wrongdoing or chicanery Robinson was alleging.
In fact, the explanation was rather more mundane — either Robinson simply misunderstood a feature of CNN’s website that causes new videos to be played on old webpages, or she knowingly misrepresented it. 
Analysis
The screenshot of the BBC News report is authentic. The story can be read here. On Dec. 8, Margaret Keenan — originally from County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland but now living in Coventry, England — became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as part of an approved vaccination rollout. 
On the day, she wore a now-famous blue Christmas charity T-shirt and a gray cardigan, and she was given her vaccination by May Parsons, a matron at the University Hospital in Coventry, who is shown in photographs and videos alongside Keenan.
The screenshot of the CNN story is more complicated. Some articles on the CNN website feature related embedded videos. Under those embedded videos, CNN places a “reel” of other video reports that are in some way related to the original one. 
So if a user navigates to the Oct. 22 CNN story in question — which carried the headline “Faulty US Covid-19 response meant 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths, report finds” — the user should see the following video by default, and at the bottom of the screen, the “reel” of related videos:

For readers accessing the October article after Dec. 8, one of those related videos had to do with Keenan and the other early recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.K. Readers can either deliberately choose one of the other videos from the reel, or simply do nothing — embedded videos on CNN have an “autoplay next” feature, meaning once a video ends, the site automatically starts up the next video in the reel. 
In this way, a reader could be on a web page that hosted an article from Oct. 22, while watching a video that was published much more recently, including the Dec. 8 video that featured Keenan receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. This is how that combination looked on CNN’s desktop site:

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


A Dec. 12, 2020, Twitter thread authored by an account using Winston Churchill as a profile picture and the user name of Harvey Staub (emojis excluded) argued that people falsely categorized as COVID-19 positive who subsequently got the flu or the common cold make the disease — and the pandemic itself — seem more dangerous than it really is. The central evidence used to support this thesis is an alleged decline in sales of the drug Tamiflu, an antiviral widely used during the flu season to hasten recovery.
As background, the assertion of false positives comes from a mischaracterization of what COVID-19 PCR tests are meant to indicate. Though there are unresolved questions about the accuracy of COVID-19 tests in general, the problem is not with so-called “false positives.” Rather, its limitation is that it detects only the presence of specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the presence of this RNA is not necessarily indicative of being infected or contagious with SARS-CoV-2. This is not a false positive for COVID-19 the disease, it is a true positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.
The argument, partially rooted in the above fallacy, goes like this: COVID-19 tests produce high rates of false positives; COVID-19 is described as deadly, but because so many people have falsely tested positive during the flu season, the deadliness or severity of COVID-19 is exaggerated by including flu deaths as COVID-19 deaths; undiagnosed flu cases are evidenced by a lack of Tamiflu prescriptions.

While we remind our readers not to take the unverified statements of anonymous Twitter accounts as truth, it is factual that there have been fewer prescriptions for Tamiflu filled this flu season. According to ABC News, “data analysts at Walgreens have tracked sales of antiviral medications for flu over the past seven years to estimate flu activity across the U.S. and 2020 has had significantly lower sales than in 2019.”
This fact can be interpreted in multiple ways. Staub interpreted it as evidence that flu cases are being under-diagnosed. Another explanation, though, is that there have actually been significantly fewer flu cases this year. The key is to defend an interpretation with actual evidence. Staub provides none. On the other hand, evidence that fewer people have contracted influenza this season, as well as data-driven explanations for why this is the case, are readily available.
For one thing, the country has been locked down and social distancing (to varying degrees) since March 2020. While this has been done to limit the spread of COVID-19, it also provides fewer opportunities to transmit the flu. With people working from home, avoiding indoor dining, and having fewer face-to-face actions, opportunities for influenza transmission are significantly —  even historically — reduced compared to an average year.
For another thing, an aggressive public health campaign encouraging flu shots to minimize the potential for co-occurring viral outbreaks resulted in historically high influenza vaccination rates this season. According to analysis based on weekly sales reports of pharmaceuticals, the IT firm IQVIA found that “23.5 million people got the flu shot from Aug. 7 through Oct. 2, compared with 12.6 million during the same timeframe in 2019.”
Even if you reject the notion that increased vaccination or reduced social contact could contribute to fewer cases of influenza, though, the fact is that the number of deaths caused by influenza and pneumonia combined in pre-pandemic years are far too low to account for the increased amount of mortality seen presently. In other words, if the signal of increased death was caused by increased influenza cases, we would be in the midst of a catastrophic flu season. This snapshot from CDC’s Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report (as of mid-December 2020) visualizes present and historical numbers of deaths caused by influenza (the yellow area) compared to deaths coded as COVID-19 (blue area):

Indeed, the best refutation of the assertion that the pandemic is overhyped or manufactured is also the simplest: Significantly more people are dying, period, than would be expected based on historical data. This reality began in April 2020, well before the influenza season, and it has not abated since. The CDC collects weekly data on this metric, known as excess mortality. By doing this on a weekly basis, the metric takes into account seasonal features like the flu season. By lumping all deaths together regardless of cause, the metric is also unaffected by any perceived problem with COVID-19 testing.
Because no evidence exists to support anything close to the level of increased flu or cold cases needed to create the level of excess mortality that characterizes this pandemic, because surveillance data suggests fewer cases of influenza, and because fewer cases of influenza are to be expected in a country with record-setting flu vaccination levels that has also been socially distancing and working from home since before the flu season began, Staub’s analysis is without merit. As such, the claim is “False.”",FALSE
7723.0,Tennessee nurse Tiffany Dover passed out because of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.,"No, a Nurse Didn’t Faint Because of the COVID-19 Vaccine
Tennessee critical care nurse Tiffany Dover became the target of vaccine misinformation as the result of an unrelated medical condition.
On Dec. 17, 2020, a nurse in Tennessee fainted on live television after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer, an incident that inevitably fueled anti-vaccine fear-mongering.
Although it’s true that Tiffany Dover, a critical care nurse at Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, passed out after receiving the Pfizer vaccine on TV, the episode was not the result of the vaccine itself. Dover later explained that she has a medical condition that renders her susceptible to fainting spells when she feels pain.
The incident can be seen in this video of the press conference posted by Chattanooga-based news station WRCB:




After the video aired, social media users and junk sites claimed that the vaccine itself was the cause of Dover’s loss of consciousness.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has found no serious side effects in tens of thousands of patients who enrolled in trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are both being rolled out for widespread use in the U.S. Some may experience flu-like symptoms after receiving the vaccine, a sign that the immune system is engaging.
In a statement after the incident, Dover said she has a medical history in which her body overreacts to pain triggers, which can include stubbed toes and hangnails, and thus her fainting spell was the result of the pain from the hypodermic needle injection, not the vaccine itself.
Frontline healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients have been among the first to receive the vaccines as they role out to the American public. Medical workers like Dover, along with members of the government, have received vaccinations on television in an effort to show the public that the vaccines are safe. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence received a vaccine shot on Dec. 18, 2020, on television, for example.
Misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic coming from social media platforms and politicians, most notably U.S. President Donald Trump, has been an ongoing hurdle for public health officials combatting the spread of the disease.

A pro-abortion rights activist found himself in the crosshairs of conservative news outlets after posting a picture of a Christmas tree on Dec. 9, 2020, with an unusual topper featuring two pairs of forceps. The tweet drew the ire of outlets like The Christian Post and Breitbart.
The tweet was deleted not long after it was posted, but an archived version shows that the tweet stated: “IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TOP OUR TOPPER,” with the hashtag #ProAbortion, #Abortions, and #Christmas.

According to the Christian Post, this tree was put up in an abortion clinic. They reached this conclusion by combing through the activist’s Twitter and LinkedIn profiles.
Michael Saenz, the person behind the tweet (whose Twitter profile is now private), had tagged two pro-abortion rights groups in his archived Twitter bio: the Clinics for Abortion and Reproductive Excellence (CARE), and We Are Pro Abortion (WAPA). As of this writing, he had removed CARE from his Twitter bio, and changed his Twitter handle.
However, there is no clear evidence that this Christmas tree was put up at an abortion clinic. According to a LinkedIn profile that anti-abortion media outlet Live Action says is connected to the same Saenz, he worked as a patient care technician with CARE from June 2017 to November 2018, and as their marketing director until January 2020. It is not clear if he is currently working with any abortion clinics. WAPA, the organization currently on his Twitter bio, is an advocacy group that aims to end stigmas around abortions, and fundraises for clinics.
The forceps are considered controversial by anti-abortion groups that claim they are used to grasp the body parts of “preborn babies” and “tear” their limbs. However, forceps are commonly used to remove the fetus or placenta during an abortion procedure called dilation and evacuation (D&E).
While it is fair to say a pro-abortion rights activist posted an image of forceps atop a Christmas tree, there is no proof that this photograph was taken at an abortion clinic. We thus rate this claim a “Mixture.”",mixture

The claim was featured in a video shared on TikTok on Dec. 15, 2020, in which two women describe the “TikTok trick” as a “Christmas miracle.” The two roommates claimed they had COVID-19 at the time of filming and both lost their sense of smell. In the clip, the duo is seen blackening an unpeeled orange on the stovetop, peeling it, mushing it in a cup, adding brown sugar, and eating it.
At the time of writing, the video had nearly 800,000 views. But despite its popularity, there is no evidence to suggest that eating any style of orange will restore a person’s loss of smell or taste due to COVID-19. In fact, science is only just beginning to understand the mechanisms behind why people lose their sense of smell from SARS-CoV-2 in the first place, much less how to restore it.
How Does the Nose Smell?
Highly specialized sensory cells known as olfactory sensory neurons make up a small patch of tissues inside of the human nose, according to the National Institutes of Health. Each olfactory neuron has one odor receptor in the brain. As substances around the nose release microscopic molecules, the neurons stimulate receptors in the brain and send messages to identify the smell.
To reach the olfactory sensory neurons, smells take one of two paths: either through the nostrils or via a channel that connects the roof of the throat to the nose. This is why scent plays such a large role in our sense of taste — chewing food releases molecules that the olfactory sensory neurons in the back of the throat can pick up on. But when this channel is blocked by an infection, the scent of food can be lost on the brain, a condition known as anosmia.
Why Does COVID-19 Infection Create a Loss of Smell?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed a “new loss of taste or smell” as a symptom of COVID-19 and it is thought that COVID-19 infection creates an inflammation reaction inside the nose that leads to the loss of the olfactory neurons. And anosmia has been shown to be an indicator of viral spread at the community level, making it an important characteristic to track when tracing COVID-19 infection.
Anosmia refers to the complete inability to detect odors, and viral anosmia isn’t unique to SARS-CoV-2. It has been determined to be a result of a number of different infections, from the common cold to a variety of human-infecting coronaviruses. In fact, viral infections have been shown to be associated with about 40% of adult anosmia cases — 15% of which are thought to be caused by a coronavirus strain.
Anosmia and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) occur when upper respiratory infections damage sensitive nerve endings, resulting in either a temporary or permanent loss of taste or smell. But the exact mechanism behind how SARS-CoV-2, in particular, causes neurological conditions is only just beginning to unfold. Research suggested in 2020 that anywhere from 40% to 80% of COVID-19 patients will experience a loss of taste or smell.
In July 2020, a team of researchers led by neuroscientists at Harvard Medical School determined that the olfactory cell types in the upper nasal cavity were the most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, olfactory sensory neurons do not express the gene that encodes ACE2 receptor protein, the protein that SARS-Cov-2 uses to enter human cells.
But Does Eating Flambeed Oranges Cure Anosmia?
Snopes spoke with Chelsae Larson, a special education teacher in Montana, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Oct. 20 and lost her sense of smell the day prior.
“It happened very abruptly. I ate breakfast and lunch as normal and when I took a bite of my dinner, I could not taste or smell anything,” she said, noting that she suffered from anosmia. “I started to gain my senses back about six weeks after my results. I still do not have my taste and smell fully back and can only smell really strong scents.”
And though Larson said that she has “eaten many oranges, tangerines, and various other fruits,” her sense of smell is still not 100% back nearly two months later.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to restoring anosmia. By and large, health experts agree that it comes down to the individual and their body’s ability to repair and regenerate damaged nerve endings.
About 90% of patients will see an improvement in their sense of smell within four weeks of infection without incident, according to medical advice published in the British Medical Journal. Some medical practitioners recommend patients regularly smell strong odors or essential odors as a way to restore their olfactory system, a concept known as “olfactory training.” Providers also suggest that using some topical corticosteroid drops or sprays could help to restore the sense of smell.
But until the sense of smell has been restored, experts recommend rigorously adhering to “use by” dates on food and drinks and ensuring all smoke alarms are functioning and tested regularly.

Rapeseed oil has been used for cooking for centuries in Europe, India, China, and Japan.
A persistent chain e-mail still makes the rounds years after it first appeared, about the origin of canola oil. What it offered was a bit of truth about a product’s family history worked into a screed against the product itself:
Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .I think it’s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you’re doing so with your eyes open.
RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE
Dear Editors
Recently I bought a cooking oil that’s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in “bad” fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.
There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new “wonder” oil with all its low-fat health benefits. It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.
Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola. Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words “Canada” and “oil”. Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants. According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, “By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are… toxic to humans and other animals”. (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)
Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent. I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years. It works very well; it suffocates them. Ask for it at your nursery. Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines. It is an industrial oil. It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.
Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the “Mad Cow disease” scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called “scrapie”. It was thought this was how “Mad Cow” began and started to infiltrate the human chain. What is interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, ‘scrapie’ disappeared.
We also haven’t seen any further reports of “Mad Cow” since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same. US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies. The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use. They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but “canola” instead.
Except canola means “Canadian oil”; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions. Look at the ingredients list on labels. Apparently peanut oil is being replaced with rape oil. You’ll find it in an alarming number of processed foods. There’s more, but to conclude: rape oil was the source of the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, which was banned after blistering the lungs and skins of hundred of thousands of soldiers and civilians during W.W.I. Recent French reports indicate that it was again in use during the Gulf War.
Check products for ingredients. If the label says, “may contain the following” and lists canola oil, you know it contains canola oil because it is the cheapest oil and the Canadian government subsidizes it to industries involved in food processing.
I don’t know what you’ll be cooking with tonight, but I’ll be using olive oil and old-fashioned butter, from a genetically unmodified cow.
Here is more information….
Canola oil from the rape seed, referred to as the Canadian oil because Canada is mainly responsible for it being marketed in the USA. The Canadian government and industry paid our Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) $50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the (GRAS) List, “Generally Recognized As Safe”. Thus a new industry was created. Laws were enacted affecting international trade, commerce, and traditional diets. Studies with lab. animals were disastrous. Rats developed fatty degeneration of heart, kidney, adrenals, and thyroid gland. When canola oil was withdrawn from their diets, the deposits dissolved but scar tissue remained on all vital organs. No studies on humans were made before money was spent to promote Canola oil in the USA.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare fatal degenerative disease caused by a build up long-chain fatty acids (c22 to c28) which destroys the myelin (protective sheath) of the nerves. Canola oil is a very long chain fatty acid oil (c22). Those who will defend canola oil say that the Chinese and Indians have used it for centuries with no effect, however it was in an unrefined form (taken from FATS THAT HEAL AND FATS THAT KILL by Udo Erasmus).
My cholesterol level was 150. After a year using Canola oil I tested 260. I switched back to pure olive oil and it has taken 5 years to get it down to 160. Thus began this project to find answers since most Doctors will say that Canola oil is O.K.
My sister spilled Canola oil on a piece of fabric, after 5 pre-treatings and harsh washings, the oil spot still showed. She stopped using Canola oil, wondering what it did to our insides if it could not be removed from cloth easily.
Our Father bred birds, always checking labels to insure there was no rape seed in their food. He said, “The birds will eat it, but they do not live very long.”
A friend, who worked for only 9 mo. as a quality control taster at an apple-chip factory where Canola oil was used exclusively for frying, developed numerous health problems. These included loose teeth & gum disease; numb hands and feet; swollen arms and legs upon rising in the morning; extreme joint pain especially in hands, cloudy vision, constipation with stools like black marbles, hearing loss; skin tears from being bumped; lack of energy; hair loss and heart pains. It has been five years since she has worked there and still has some joint pain, gum disease, and numbness.
A fellow worker, about 30 years old, who ate very little product, had a routine check up and found that his blood vessels were like those of an 80 year old man. Two employees fed the waste product to baby calves and their hair fell out. After removing the fried apple chips from the diet their hair grew back in.
My daughter and her girls were telling jokes. Stephanie hit her mom’s arm with the back of a butter knife in a gesture, “Oh mom” not hard enough to hurt. My daughters arm split open like it was rotten. She called me to ask what could have caused it. I said, “I’ll bet anything that you are using Canola oil”. Sure enough, there was a big gallon jug in the pantry.
Rape seed oil is a penetrating oil, to be used in light industry, not for human consumption. It contains a toxic substance. Even after the processing to reduce the erucic acid content, it is still a penetrating oil. We have found that it turns rancid very fast. Also it leaves a residual rancid odor on clothing.

Canola oil is a health hazard to use as a cooking oil or salad oil. It is not the healthy oil we thought it was. It is not fit for human consumption, do not eat canola oil, it can hurt you. Polyunsaturated or not, this is a bad oil.

Happy Frying,
There is no earthly reason to give any credence to this rumor: Canola oil is not the horrifying product this widely-disseminated e-mail makes it out to be, nor has the FDA turned loose on the American public a health scourge worthy of being named one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
An appreciation of what this scare is based upon begins with a better understanding of what canola oil and how it came into being.
The rape plant (Brassica napus) is a member of the mustard family, as claimed in the e-mail. However, before associations between rape and mustard gas set in too strongly, it should be noted turnip, cabbage, watercress, horseradish, and radish are also members of this family of plants.
Rapeseed oil has been used for cooking for centuries in Europe, India, China, and Japan. As modern science is finding out, its previous use wasn’t necessarily a guarantee of safety. Cooking at high temperatures with unrefined rapeseed oil now appears to be related to an increased risk of lung cancer because at high temperatures cooking oil gives off chemicals capable of causing mutations in cells. Unrefined rapeseed oil is particularly notable for this, but other oils also have this association. Those intent upon doing large amounts of wok cooking with any sort of cooking oil should therefore lower their frying temperature from the 240°C to 280°C called for in Chinese cooking to 180°C.
Rapeseed oil naturally contains a high percentage (30-60%) of erucic acid, a substance associated with heart lesions in laboratory animals. For this reason rapeseed oil was not used for consumption in the United States prior to 1974, although it was used in other countries. (Americans chose to use it as a lubricant to maintain Allied naval and merchant ships during World War II.)
In 1974, rapeseed varieties with a low erucic content were introduced. Scientists had found a way to replace almost all of rapeseed’s erucic acid with oleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fatty acid. (This change was accomplished through the cross-breeding of plants, not by the techniques commonly referred to as “genetic engineering.”) By 1978, all Canadian rapeseed produced for food use contained less than 2% erucic acid. The Canadian seed oil industry rechristened the product “canola oil” (Canadian oil) in 1978 in an attempt to distance the product from negative associations with the word “rape.” Canola was introduced to American consumers in 1986. By 1990, erucic acid levels in canola oil ranged from 0.5% to 1.0%, in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards.
This light, tasteless oil’s popularity is due to the structure of its fats. It is lower in saturated fat (about 6%) than any other oil. Compare this to the high saturated fat content of peanut oil (about 18%) and palm oil (at an incredibly high 79%). It also contains more cholesterol-balancing monounsaturated fat than any oil except olive oil and has the distinction of containing Omega-3 fatty acids, a polyunsaturated fat reputed to not only lower both cholesterol and triglycerides, but also to contribute to brain growth and development.
In other words, it’s a healthy oil. One shouldn’t feel afraid to use it because of some Internet scare loosely based on half-truths and outright lies.",FALSE

1236.0,Fentanyl users are stabbing their needles into toilet paper rolls in public bathrooms to clean them.,"Are Fentanyl Users Cleaning Needles by Poking Toilet Paper Rolls?
Even if they are, it is unlikely fentanyl exposure by simple skin contact could poison someone.
In August 2019, a claim suggesting intravenous (IV) drug users were contaminating toilet paper in public restrooms circulated on social media. In this instance, the alleged contaminant was fentanyl:

This was a variation of a familiar claim regarding IV drug use and toilet paper in public restrooms, which we identified as unproven in March 2019. In that fact check, titled “Are IV Drug Users Cleaning Needles by Poking Toilet Paper Rolls?,” several federal and state-level drug agencies suggested the practice was not familiar to them:
A spokesperson for OSHA told us that the organization had not heard of this practice. We received a similar response from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Institute told us that concerned citizens should check with their local public health departments for more information, but, generally speaking, the organization had no evidence that drug users were cleaning needles by stabbing them into toilet paper rolls in public bathrooms.
Further, the addition of fentanyl places this new claim into a variation of another regularly debunked brand of rumor: that one can be poisoned by simple skin exposure to fentanyl. A joint position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) disputes that notion:
The American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) collaborated on a formal position statement using the best available evidence to ameliorate [concerns about skin exposure] and revise those recommendations [for professionals that may come in contact with it]. Citing established pharmacokinetic literature on fentanyl patches, the position statement directly challenged the potential for severe toxicity from just touching fentanyl.
We rate the newer variation as “Unproven” because it describes a single incident without corroborating evidence. We note, however, that the claim mixes two previously established rumors, one of which — that fentanyl can poison via skin contact alone — is extremely unlikely to be factual.

1305.0,Sexpert Dr. Ruth Westheimer served as a sniper in Israel.,"Dr. Ruth Was a Sniper?
Did sexpert Dr. Ruth Westheimer serve as a sniper in Israel?
Origins:   Diminutive Dr. Ruth Westheimer (4’7″) is the nation’s most well-known sex 
doctor. Though you wouldn’t suspect it from the grandmotherly appearance of “Dr. Ruth,” 
 
this psychosexual therapist has been dispensing frank sex advice since 1980.  (Across that span of time, she says the language in which queries are phrased has become more explicit, but the questions themselves have remained the same.)
The odd juxtaposition of her appearance and professional calling is not the only surprise to Dr. Ruth: there is also the small matter of her having trained in her youth as a sniper with the Israeli Defense Force. 
The future Dr. Ruth was born Karola Ruth Siegel in Germany in 1928, the only child of an Orthodox Jewish couple. In 1939, after young Karola’s father had been taken by the Nazis, her mother and grandmother sent her to Switzerland to get her out of harm’s way.  She did not see her family again, as her mother and grandmother died in the Holocaust.
At 
16, the orphaned girl moved to Israel and joined Haganah, an underground Jewish military organization. She served as a lookout and trained as a
sniper, but she avers that she never killed (or presumably shot) anyone.  Said Dr. Ruth of that interval in her life: 


When I was in my routine training for the Israeli army as a teenager, they discovered completely by chance that I was a lethal sniper. I could hit the target smack in the center further away than anyone could believe. Not just that, even though I was tiny and not even much of an athlete, I was incredibly accurate throwing hand grenades too. Even today I can load a Sten automatic rifle in a single minute, blindfolded.”


Her military career was cut short when she was seriously injured:


My legs were almost ripped off on my 20th birthday in 1948 in Jerusalem from cannon ball shrapnel which exploded in the student’s residence where I was living. Three other students were killed instantly and many more were wounded. The metal pierced both my legs, and there was blood everywhere. A cannon ball from Jordan had smashed through the window. I was thrown 20 feet. The strangest thing was that all I could think about was whether there might be some blood on the brand-new shoes I had just gotten for my birthday, and amazingly there wasn’t even a drop on them, which was all I cared about in some kind of strange denial.


Ruth later moved to Paris, where she studied psychology at the Sorbonne and taught kindergarten, then immigrated to the U.S. in 1956 and obtained a Master’s degree in Sociology and a Ph.D. in Education from Columbia University. A job with Planned Parenthood spurred her to study human sexuality.

1310.0,"Jack Andraka, 15, came up with a “100 percent accurate” cancer-detection method that was “168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive” than current methods.","Did a 15-Year-Old Invent a ‘100% Accurate’ Pancreatic Cancer Test?
A prize-winning, high-school science project claiming to be a new diagnostic tool for cancer came with a lot of hype.
On Aug. 22, 2019, The Epoch Times ran a profile of a “15-year-old science buff” who invented a 100% effective diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer. This was a curious editorial decision, as the 15-year-old in question was 22 in 2019, and the more sensational claims he had made years ago had been significantly tempered — facts Andraka himself has acknowledged but that did not make their way into the Epoch Times story.
First, here’s what the story gets right. As a 15-year-old, Jack Andraka gained fame for prototyping a potential test for pancreatic cancer that was purportedly quicker and cheaper than existing methods, for which he was awarded the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. In 2014, then-Forbes healthcare reporter (and current medical reporter at STAT) Matthew Herper described the concept this way:
He created a device by dipping filter paper into a solution of carbon nanotubes coated with antibodies for a specific protein that can be elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer. He proved that the device can detect the presence of that protein, mesothelin, in cell culture solutions. He also showed that the sensor could tell the difference between the blood of mice that had human pancreatic tumors grafted onto them and those that did not.
Herper, in his capacity as the author of that year’s Forbes 30 under 30 list of promising young scientists, had reviewed a draft of a paper Andraka had written about his test along with six other expert reviewers. In a piece titled “Why Biotech Whiz Kid Jack Andraka Is Not On The Forbes 30 Under 30 List,” he relayed the concerns of five anonymous reviewers and one non-anonymous reviewer: Harvard DNA sequencing pioneer George Church. Church concluded that many of the claims “may not hold up, or at least require more work to be proven.”
Others, like the pancreatic cancer researcher who discovered mesothelin in the first place, Ira Paston, had gone further. In a 2015 Sydney Morning Herald piece, Paston stated that the method Andraka proposed “makes no scientific sense,” and that Paston didn’t “know anybody in the scientific community who believes his findings.”
Andraka, for his part, has also recognized that the problem is more complex than his earlier statements might have suggested. In an email to Herper in 2014, Andraka wrote:
While promising, the project really was extremely preliminary and is by no means as sophisticated as some stories say it is … I realize that in retrospect that it was just a high school science fair project and it was a proof of concept experiment and initially I thought that it could get on the market in 1-2 years however I’ve learned so much over the course of this journey and realized that it will in reality take a lot longer than this.
Here we get into the weeds of the claims made (most recently) by The Epoch Times, but which form the basis of other continually recurring clickbait stories.
“168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive”
In a 2012 TEDx Talk, among other places, Andraka stated that his test was “168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive.” Any reporting citing these numbers is merely repeating, uncritically, claims which misrepresent the time and cost of existing technology. One of the few existing methods for pancreatic cancer detection is via ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests. Specifically, ELISA tests that identify the presence of a chemical known as CA 19-9 can be evidence of tumors in some cases of pancreatic cancer.
According to Church, Andraka’s time comparison overstates the amount of time such ELISA tests take. The comparison Andraka used was 14 hours. ELISA, however, is fairly quick these days. A modern CA 19-9 ELISA panel, for example, takes 1.5 hours to run. Suggesting it takes 14 hours inflates significantly the speed comparison in favor of Andraka’s test.
Church also stated that the cost comparison employed by Andraka was flawed because it compared only the manufacturing costs on his invention’s side but included profit and overhead on the ELISA test side:
Andraka is comparing the commercial cost for a test – including the manufacturer’s profit and overhead – to his own materials cost. That’s not a fair comparison. He says the only mesothelin test that he found cost $912 per kit. But other ELISA tests are for sale online for $400 per 60 tests or $600 for 96 tests – in other words, about $6.50 per test run. That still compares favorably to Andraka’s $3 per 10 tests, but remember that there would also be a commercial markup if a company decided to sell his tests.
As for sensitivity, Church argued that the results presented by Andraka varied too much to say anything about sensitivity (a measure that gets at potential false positives).
A “100 percent accurate” “cancer-detection method”
Andraka was able to spend six months in the lab of a Johns Hopkins Medical Center researcher where he tested his test using blood from mice who had pancreatic cancer compared to those who didn’t. Such tests, even if they produced promising results, would not be the same as demonstrating efficacy as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer in humans.
Outside of accuracy — i.e., the ability to correctly identify humans with pancreatic cancer — the early detection of the disease was also central to the project, something Andraka would not have been able to test directly for his work at Hopkins. Ira Pastan, the National Cancer Institutes researcher who discovered mesothelin, the biomarker used in Andraka’s test, told The Sydney Morning Herald that the protein is not actually elevated in the blood in early pancreatic cancer patients and thus could not be indicative of the early stages of the disease. Other scientific studies support Pastan’s objection.
A 2013 study into the diagnostic efficacy of mesothelin on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (a form of pancreatic cancer) concluded that the biomarker was “a weak diagnostic classifier on its own” but may be of use as part of a larger panel test. Mesothelin is also present in cases of other cancers as well, including “malignant mesothelioma and … ovarian, and lung adenocarcinomas. In a 2015 statement provided to Sydney Morning Herald reporter Nick Bryant by John Hopkins University, the institution made clear the results were far too preliminary to declare such accuracy or to speculate on its future success:
“[Andraka’s’] idea was considered by his mentor to be of scientific interest,” the hospital told me in a written statement, “but his experiments at Johns Hopkins were highly preliminary.” They represented nothing more than “the very earliest stages of determining whether such a test is feasible or likely”. It also noted that his results had not been confirmed, peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal. “Thus, it is unlikely that a test based on his idea will soon be available to people.”
“[Andraka] currently also holds the international patent on the device”
Andraka does not hold an international patent on his device. Although he applied for one in 2012, that application was ultimately denied based on lacking an “inventive step.”
All told, media outlets like The Epoch Times continue to run with an out-of-date and highly clickable fairytale that has not been accurate since at least 2014. Andraka himself acknowledges the shortcomings of his earlier scientific pronouncements and is thankful for the criticism he has received, telling (for example) The Sydney Morning Herald in 2015 that “I really appreciate their concerns because their concerns made my project better. It was definitely a learning curve.”",mostly-false

Syncope, the medical term for fainting, can be brought on by acts of hair care.
On July 7, 2019, Facebook user Alicia Brown Phillips brought attention to a fainting disorder known as “hair-grooming syncope” when she shared a message concerning a scary ordeal that reportedly occurred while she was attempting to curl her little sister’s hair:
I experienced one of the scariest moments of my life this morning with my little sister and I am going to put this out there because I had never heard of this in my life!
Hair-grooming Syncope …
Look it up. This morning I was curling my little sister Gracie’s hair for church. I was maybe about five minutes in and she starts to gag a little and looks kind of pale. I asked her if she was going to get sick and she shook her head yes. I get my little daughters out of the bathroom and start to hold her hair up for her as she leans over the toilet. 30 seconds later… she looks at me. She is extremely pale with blue lips and starts to pass out. Her pupils got really big and I caught her. I start screaming for Dale to come help. Gracie has a blank stare and look on her face and is completely unresponsive and limp for about a minute. Her hands were also shaking. Very seizure like. She then comes back to and says she feels much better. She says she remembers hearing us talk but couldn’t see us. I was crying. She was very confused. My mom and dad rush to my house and a few hours in Children’s hospital, an EKG, and a head scan later… she is fine. Turns out there is something called hair-grooming syncope affects kids from ages 5-13. They said they see about 1-5 cases a year. Turns out brushing, curling, braiding, or drying can cause nerve stimulation on the scalp and cause some children to have seizure like symptoms. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE! We were told if she ever starts to feel nauseous or light headed while getting her hair brushed to sit down and take a break. I am putting this out there for others to see. If a kid ever complains of their belly hurting or feeling light headed while they are getting their hair done, make sure they take a seat and keep a close eye on them! Apparently very rare but so scary to see it happen!

This Facebook post garnered ten of thousands of shares and comments within a few days of its initial posting. In addition to expressing concern for the child’s health, many commentators, like Phillips herself, were surprised to learn about this condition.
“Syncope” is the medical term for fainting. “Hair-grooming syncope” refers to fainting that is brought on during hair grooming activities.
A 1996 study defined the condition as follows: “Hair-grooming syncope is a rare and benign variety of neurocardiogenic syncope that should be considered in girls that complain of loss of consciousness during different hair care acts, even if seizures are present.”
A 2009 study found that while this condition occurs most frequently in females, male children can also experience hair-grooming syncope: “Of the 111 patients, 78% were girls. We found characteristic difference between boys and girls with boys experiencing syncope more during hair cutting whereas girls experienced syncope more during hair combing and brushing.”
We weren’t able to find any concrete numbers regarding how often hair-grooming syncope occurs. Knoxville’s WBIR reported that doctors see a “handful” of cases a year, but it’s possible this condition often goes undiagnosed because most parents aren’t aware that the condition exists, or it may be misdiagnosed as epilepsy:

While an instance of hair-grooming syncope may certainly be scary for those involved (especially if it involves a seizure), the biggest difference between this condition and other bouts of fainting is that hair-grooming syncope is specifically triggered by the brushing, combing, curling, or cutting of hair, as pediatrician Dr. Kurt Brandt observed: “Syncope is basically passing out, and hair grooming is known to be a precipitant of that … It may be the pulling of the hair, possibly pain, possibly stimulation of the scalp … Your blood pressure goes down and you pass out.”",TRUE

1325.0,Three cats in Wyoming were diagnosed with the bubonic plague.,"Were Three Cats in Wyoming Diagnosed with Bubonic Plague?
Officials issued an advisory to residents after a spate of cases within a six-month period.
Officials in Wyoming warned residents on 4 January 2019 about the dangers of bubonic plague after confirming that a third cat in the state had been diagnosed with the disease within a six-month period.
The Wyoming Department of Health (WDH), though, added that no humans have been diagnosed with the plague, which is characterized by symptoms including “extreme exhaustion,” vomiting and diarrhea, and tenderness in the lymph glands among other symptoms.
The department said that the three cats diagnosed with the plague were found in separate counties. The last case involving a human in the state was diagnosed in 2008.
However, epidemiologist Alexia Harrist, a health officer with the agency, warned, “The disease can be passed to humans from ill animals and by fleas coming from infected animals. We are letting people know of the potential threat in the cat’s home area as well as across the state.”
The WDH’s statement was picked up by legitimate news outlets outside the state, prompting some readers to contact us seeking verification.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, the disease is one of three forms of plague spread by transmission of the bacteria Yersinia Pestis. However, it is rarely transmitted from human to human; on average there are about seven cases of humans catching the plague a year in the U.S. One case, diagnosed in Idaho in June 2018, was the first of its type seen in that state in nearly 30 years.
While rarely seen within the U.S. in modern times, the plague is blamed for the “Black Death” pandemic that decimated parts of three continents in the 14th century, killing an estimated 60 percent of the population in Europe alone. Researchers discovered the Yersinia Pestis bacteria during a more recent pandemic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that originated in China and went on to kill 10 million people worldwide.
We contacted the Wyoming Health Department seeking more information about the recent cases involving cats, but did not hear back prior to publication.",TRUE

2575.0,X-ray image documents a case of a penile fracture.,"Penile Fracture
Rumor: X-ray image documents a case of penile fracture.
Example:   [Collected via e-mail, August 2008]


A PENIS can break.
Luckily, it is rare. During an erection, blood flows into the penis through erectile tissue called the corpus cavernosa, which becomes rigid when the blood fills it. If an erect penis is struck very hard, it’s possible to fracture this tissue. If a fracture occurs, a man might hear a popping or cracking sound, and will most likely experience excruciating pain and bruising. It’s very important to get to an emergency room to be treated by a urologist as soon as possible if this happens.
Some mild fractures may resolve without surgery, but most urologists prefer to operate in order to reduce the risk of scar tissue and impotence that may often result. Because these injuries do not affect the testes,
where sperm is produced and stored, they do not affect fertility, but they may make it impossible for a man to have intercourse.

   
Origins:   The “Fauxtography” section of this site includes many examples of real photographs to which explanations that are completely fictitious or full of erroneous details have been attached.  This example is an unusual 
reverse case in which a fairly accurate explanation has been attached to a fabricated picture.
Penile fracture is a real (albeit rare) injury, a “rupture of the corpus cavernosum that occurs when the penis is erect.”  In May 2007, for example, the Journal of Medical Case Reports presented a case of a 37-year-old man who suffered complete urethral disruption from blunt trauma sustained during sexual intercourse:


A 37 year old man presented with a sudden cracking sound and acute pain during sexual intercourse followed by rapid detumescence, penile swelling and discoloration. Pain was aggravated by trying to urinate, but he could not pass the urine. Six hours after the penile trauma the patient was admitted to the emergency department.
Physical examination revealed a swollen, ecchymotic penis, blood on the urethral meatus and palpably full bladder. A retrograde urethrogram showed complete disruption at the proximal third of the urethra. The patient underwent immediate surgical exploration and repair of the fracture.


That same article presented an overview of the typical occurrences and treatment of such injuries:


Penile fracture is a relatively rare condition caused by a blunt trauma to the erected penis. The most frequent reported mechanism of trauma is 
unphysiological bending of the erect penis during sexual intercourse or masturbation.
Vigorous sexual intercourse is the main cause of penile fracture in the Western world. Because of high energy trauma urethral rupture is associated in up to 38% of penile fractures. The majority of cases in the Eastern world are results of patients snapping and kneading of their penis during erection to achieve detumescence. Due to a low energy trauma the urethra is rarely involved. Usually urethral rupture is partial, rarely complete.
Early conservative treatment with cold applications, pressure dressings, catheterization, anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and erection suppressing drugs is now replaced with immediate surgical repair. Since the repair reduces the complication of fracture it is now the gold standard for treatment of penile fractures.


However, the x-ray image shown above that supposedly illustrates a case of penile fracture is a fabrication (reportedly made using modeling clay and a chicken bone).  Although the male of many species of mammal does have a baculum (a bony rod within the penis also known as a “penis bone” or “penile bone”), that structure is not found in human beings.  The interior of a human penis is mostly sponge-like and contains no solid, bone-like structure that could snap in half as pictured above.     
The x-ray illustration shown here also includes other subtle bits of humor, such as the image of a bolt fastener (commonly called a “nut”) inside the scrotal sac (where one would find the testes, commonly referred to in slang terminology as “nuts”).",FALSE
